# Data Mining

These projects are assignments for the course Data Mining of DIT-NKUA.

__Project 1__ is about text classification & clustering. For the clustering is used KMeans. The classification can be achieved by different classifiers such as svm, random forests, naive bayes and a simple KNN implementation. Also there are included statistic functions to calculate precision, accuracy etc.

__Project 2__ is about evaluation of a data set based on categorical & numerical features. The evaluation can be achieved through svm, random forests or naive bayes with 10-cross validation. Also the selection of the features to achieve better precision is based on the result of information gain.

9560	9561	Sam Adams founder: Beer is more than just 'cold, fizzy and in a can' 	"The craft beer boom, which and been attributed to millennials, has been kind to brewers like Samuel Adams, which have been brewing craft beers for the past 30 years – when millennials weren't even born. The increasing interest in craft beers hasn’t gone unnoticed by beer giants like MillerCoors and Anheuser-Busch. As a result, the two companies have tried their hands at scooping up a part of the market for themselves – MillerCoors’ with Blue Moon and Anheuser-Busch with Shock Top. Their efforts haven’t been for nothing. , Shock Top is the fastest growing craft beer. Similarly, in the last four years. And while many fans of real craft beers – – argue that those , semantics matter little when it comes to sales. It’s hard to compete with companies like that when it comes to production, admits Jim Koch, founder of Boston Beer Company, which brews Samuel Adams beers. Boston Beer Company has 1,000 employees and , meaning they are to beer what sommeliers are to wine. Koch talks about making beer for creativity, quality and taste – throwing in rose hips and other garden-scented ingredients into a spring beer and expanding product offerings. Sam Adams is also expanding beyond beer into hard cider and malt beverages, which consumers have been demanding more, , a beverage industry analyst for Standard and Poor’s. In response, Samuel Adams started producing , which became the country's top-selling cider only eight months after it launched, and a hard iced tea called Twisted Tea. For now, of the beer market. To find out more about life at Sam Adams, we caught up with him to chat about everything from micro-brewing to micro-lending to being a bridesmaid. It's surprising. You know when I started Sam Adams 30 years ago, even the term ""craft beer"" did not exist. If you told me [then] that in 30 years, American craft brewers would have changed the landscape – not only in United States, but set a model for craft brewing in the rest of the world – I would have been stunned. Craft beer is in a middle of a boom in the US. In a declining US beer industry, craft beer grew 20% last year. When I started, my business plan was that it would take five years to grow to 5,000 barrels, which was about $1m in revenue and eight employees, and then it would level off. I was horribly wrong, but horribly wrong in a right direction. Well, Sam Adams has become the leading craft brewer, one of the original pioneers. To me, a lot of the fun is to continue pioneer new beers and other innovations like cider. Last year, we put in a nano brewery in Boston to be able to do 10-gallon batches of beer and to continue to experiment with beer styles, new brewing techniques, new ingredients in beer. We had a really successful this year that had rose hips, powdered plums, hibiscus, anise, vanilla, tamarind, grains of paradise, lemon zest, coriander, orange peel. I think that the continuing hallmarks of Sam Adams in particular and craft beer in general are creativity and innovation. It's pretty interesting. Most people don't know this, but my background is in manufacturing and quality control. I was a manufacturing consultant for Boston Consulting Group, BCG, for almost seven years. I enjoyed it. I learned a lot about business and after six years, I guess, I wasn't learning that much more about business, I was learning about how to be a consultant, and I didn't want to be a consultant for the rest of my life. So when I realized that, I told BCG that I wanted to leave and I didn't want to work for a big corporation. I've seen them in my years as a consultant and it just wasn't a place that I wanted to go. I saw the dysfunctions of big corporations and I really didn't want to be part of that. I decided that I would start my own company – I just didn't know what at first. I thought about a lot of things and kept coming back to brewing. And again, there were no craft beers back then. There was no role model for success, but it was something that I was passionate about. I am actually the sixth oldest son in a row to be a brewer. So, there was a certain pull from that family history and it just all came together. It seemed that it was going to be something that would be really challenging, but worthwhile. We are selling higher quality beers and in order to do that you gotta have more highly trained people who can describe to the consumer the quality and character of the beer. This has been true since the beginning, because I sold the beer myself for most of the company's history. What I soon realized was that I wasn't just offering a physical product, I had to educate people about quality and taste in beer and where it came from and what the ingredients were and what the style was. [I had] to teach people to think about beer differently than cold, fizzy and in a can, which was the way people thought about beer when I started. I learned early on that I was not just providing product, a beer; I needed to provide beer education and tradition. At that point, my original investors had been in for over a decade and had not seen any return on their investment. My investors were not institutions – [they were] drinking buddies, some relatives. And they have seen no return on their investment even though the company had been successful, so going public was a way for them to get a return on their investment, but for me to continue to keep control of it, because I have all the voting shares. Not so much, because I still have all the voting shares so I still have control. Being public has its plusses and minuses. One of the plusses is increased transparency, which is not a bad thing for a company. Because of the voting shares, I can focus on long-term success and value creation. I don't have to worry about quarterly earnings, even annual earnings, because nobody can fire me. It's a little different that way – I can focus on long-term value creation. To me, you should be innovative about all the important things that you do. Frankly, I was a little naive, but I thought public offering meant that the shares went to the public. And when the bankers described the process to me, I realized: ""Oh, no, the public can't really get shares."" Particularly, if it's a good deal. Institutions get the shares and then the public gets to buy them at a mark-up. I think we were the first ones to do this – we put coupons on six packs and we sold shares . So the public actually got the lower price and the investment banks were … ah, didn't want to do that. They were arm-twisting about truly letting the public in to the public offering and a lot of those people still hold shares, almost 20 years later. Those are the kind of investors you want. That was just fun. I got to be a bridesmaid. I was a bridesmaid three times. Truly, I am always a bridesmaid, never a bride. The inspiration goes all the way back to when I went to not just Harvard Business School, but Harvard Law School. While I was there, I worked on the environmental law review and wrote an article about what was then called corporate social responsibility, making the observation that companies that seem to pay attention to that actually performed better financially. It's my belief that companies that are mindful of their larger responsibilities beyond just shareholder returns, generally perform better with their shareholders. We always had a number of philanthropic activities but they were not that satisfying to me. The one that was kind of an epiphany for me was painting a community center here. The management team went out and we spent the day working together painting a community center that needed work, but couldn't afford it. And I didn't feel really good about it, because as a business my mission is to add value. I was walking back to my car and I realized I probably spent $20,000 worth of management time to do about $2,000 worth of bad painting. That's not creating value. I felt that Boston should bring the same creativity and innovation to our philanthropic activities that we do to the rest of our business. We took a year, thought about a lot of different things with the focus on: how do we add the most value to our communities? We settled on Brewing the American Dream, which is a micro-lending and coaching and counseling program for small business in the area that we know, which is food, beverage and hospitality. That's something that we are good at and we have people who are very knowledgeable. The other part in the origin is that when I started Sam Adams, I realized there were a lot of things, nuts and bolts of business, that I didn't understand and where I made mistakes. I've got a business degree from Harvard Business School and a law degree from Harvard Law School, you'd think I would know some of this stuff. But there's just so many nuts and bolts when you start a small business and you are a CEO of everything … I knew about brewing, I was passionate about beer but I didn't know how to negotiate a real estate lease. I didn't know how to set up payroll. I didn't know how to make a sales call. I didn't know how to design a label. I didn't know how to hire PR. I could go on and on. And those are all really important things. So what we do is, in addition to the loans, we provide coaching and counseling on nuts and bolt in food, beverage and hospitality. We have sessions called speed coaching; it's a technique modeled on speed dating that we invented for this program. We got small business owners and entrepreneurs to come – here in Boston, we usually do it at the brewery – and they will sign up for 20-minute coaching sessions with six or eight different experts in the area that are relevant to their business, problems that they are struggling with. They'd go one place and talk to a guy whose expertise is procuring unusual ingredients from all over the world, because some of these entrepreneurs come up with these interesting recipes from their own cultures. Then the next place they'd go talk to somebody about how do you design a package for it. And the next place will be how do you do an interview, how do you hire people. So they get instant expertise on these areas where nuts and bolts really matter. ﻿﻿We have been making cider in the US for almost 20 years and about three years ago, we came to believe that there was an opportunity in cider that was somewhat like craft beer 30 years ago – a traditional beverage that had a lot of quality, natural ingredients, but was underrepresented in the United States. I believe cider was 0.2% of the US beer market. We've been making cider for almost 20 years, but a lot of it was playing around, experimenting with different apples. We got our technical expertise from two gentlemen who retired from , [an Irish cider maker] in the mid-90s. One was the technical director there and one was the head cider maker. So we had access to two of the world's best cider makers that trained us for 20 years and we decided to put that learning to use and developed a new cider called Angry Orchard. It has been significantly more successful than we thought and it created a lot of excitement and growth in the cider category in the US. Since we launched angry orchard, the cider category has tripled – off of a really small base. I don't know how big it's going to get. I don't know if it's going to keep growing, but it's the kind of high quality, traditional, niche product where we can bring some innovation around quality. That's going to help develop a category. That's really at the core of our mission and strategy, because as a small company – we're only over 1% of the US beer business – we can't compete on cost and efficiency with the large global brewers. They are so much better at that than we could ever be. As a result, we have to do something unique, different and something that's inherently small. If it's going to be a big category quickly, big brewers are going to be much better at it than we are. Actually, it's been not quite a year. Again, to illustrate the point, before we did that, we spent almost two years redesigning the beer can to create a better taste experience. We have that is different than the standard beer can. It has a different shape on the top and a larger, wider lid, both of which open your mouth up when you are drinking from Sam Adams can so it makes it more like drinking from a glass. Typical beverage cans, as consumer is well aware, [are] the same. Whether you are putting beer in it or diet soda or tomato juice or energy drink, every beverage can is the same. It's clearly not optimized for beer. And if you notice when you are drinking from a can, the can is designed to have as small as possible lid, because that is the cheapest can. The lid is the most expensive part, that's why cans taper in so that you get the smallest possible lid cause that will give you the cheapest can. Unfortunately, what that means for a taste experience as you drink from a standard beverage can, you essentially suck out of it. You form a seal with your mouth over the opening and suck the beverage out of it. You don't actually get the flavor experience until you pull it away from your mouth, and you get air ingress into your nasal and retro nasal passages. In Sam Adams can, the wider and hour glass shape at the top of it – so it doesn't just come in, it comes in and then it goes out. Those function to force your mouth to open as you drink from it, so you drink more slowly, but you get more taste."	Business
10801	10802	Slump in oil prices could mean fall in investment and future shortages – IEA 	The International Energy Agency has warned that the current slump in oil prices will hold back investment and could create shortages in the future as overall energy demand is forecast to grow by 37% in the next 25 years. But at the same time, the organisation, which was set up in the aftermath of previous price shocks, said that while more drilling was needed, it was still important that governments wound down the world’s $550bn (£346bn) of annual fossil fuel subsidies and switched support to renewable power. The IEA said oil and gas would play a continuing role as demand continued to rise, but that politicians should not shirk the need to tackle climate change, as the current trajectory of carbon use would leave humanity facing “a very different” world. “Today’s price level may offer some comfort to consumers but it will not last very long,” said Fatih Birol, IEA chief economist. “A well-supplied oil market in the short term should not disguise the challenges that lie ahead, as the world is set to rely more heavily on a relatively small number of producing countries.” Birol, speaking at the , said there were already signs of a 10% cut in US spending by oil companies as a result of the slump in oil prices there to $80 per barrel. This came at a time when investment in other key future crude producers such as Iraq was close to zero. American shale oil and gas had transformed the market but post-2020 the world would increasingly find itself relying on Canada, Brazil and the politically volatile Middle East for world oil supplies, he said. Birol said countries such as Russia, China and India needed to wind down their consumer-price subsidies for fossil fuels, which deterred renewable power investment, squandered valuable energy resources and gave their citizens “all the wrong messages.” The IEA estimates that wind, solar and other renewable technologies received subsidies of $121bn last year and this figure would rise to $230bn by 2030 before falling back to $205bn in 2040. The organisation hailed the performance of renewables as “incredible” and expected it to provide half of global electricity generation by 2040, with the bulk of the advances being made in China. “As our global energy system grows and transforms, signs of stress continue to emerge,” said Maria van der Hoeven, the IEA’s executive director. “But renewables are expected to go from strength to strength, and it is incredible that we can now see a point where they become the world’s number one source of electricity generation.” The IEA also gave its support to the development of new nuclear power projects, but said it was vital that governments found a permanent solution to dealing with high level radioactive waste. A separate report warned that uncertainty in the UK over subsidies for offshore windfarms had forced the industry to shelve a series of new projects. The study by the independent thinktank Green Alliance, titled , argued that without a long-term commitment, the industry would be unable to achieve the economies of scale needed to bring down costs. Energy secretary Ed Davey said this week that onshore wind power was already suffering after communities secretary Eric Pickles called in 50 planning applications. Davey said the Tory minister was undermining investor confidence in an industry that employs more than 15,000 workers.	Business
6726	6727	British Gas owner Centrica warns of higher gas costs 	"Senior executives at British have been accused of being an ""utter disgrace"" after being awarded a potentially generous pay deal just as they warned that more price rises were on the way. The attack from a member of parliament's energy and climate change committee came as a large group of shareholders voted against the remuneration report while other companies faced the latest blowback from the ""shareholder spring"". Vladimir Kim, the top shareholder in the mining firm Kazakhmys, said he would step down as chairman within 12 months, a new executive pay package at oil services group Petrofac faced opposition from shareholders and a quarter of investors rejected a remuneration report at shipbroker Clarkson. But the greatest acrimony came at , the parent group of British Gas, after it warned that it might have to increase energy bills this winter by at least £50. John Robertson, a Glasgow MP, who sits on the energy select committee, said: ""It's clear that Centrica think this is a good day to bury bad bills. The fact they chose this day to announce these price rises, when [former chief executive of News International] Rebekah Brooks is before [the] Leveson [inquiry)], shows they are an utter disgrace,"" he said. ""This government has to act to put an end to greedy gas companies taking hard-pressed customers for a ride. Pensioners in my constituency are only just getting over the budget, now they are hit with the prospect of rising energy bills."" Centrica's chief executive, Sam Laidlaw, and the British Gas managing director, Phil Bentley, were accused by one investor of presiding over an ""arrogant"" company that had been fined £2.5m for not investigating customer complaints properly. Another shareholder asked Laidlaw whether he would hand back the bonus element of his remuneration package of nearly £4m, a question that finally triggered an impassioned defence of the chief executive by Sir Roger Carr, the Centrica chairman. ""We are very fortunate to have Sam Laidlaw for this business,"" said Carr. ""For five years he has done a remarkable job for this company and one I am very proud to be associated with."" The group pay arrangements had very high hurdles in place that had to be overcome for bonus payouts to be made, he argued, but 12% of shareholders still voted against the remuneration report when it came up for approval. Both the Pension & Investment Research Consultant and the Association of British Insurers had raised concerns about the pay proposals. Meanwhile in a statement British Gas said wholesale gas prices for the forthcoming winter were about 15% higher than last year and non-commodity costs – such as transportation and environment levies – could add £50 to the cost of supplying the average household this year."

12365	12366	Ole Gunnar Solskjaer appointed manager of Cardiff City 	" is confident he will have complete control of football matters as Cardiff City's new manager and has insisted that he has no reservations about working under Vincent Tan, the club's controversial owner. Speaking on the day he was appointed as Malky Mackay's successor, Solskjaer said that he was going into the job with ""open eyes"" and with the aim of turning Cardiff into a top-10 Premier League club. The Norwegian, who has agreed a 12-month rolling contract, dismissed suggestions that Sir Alex Ferguson had told him not to go anywhere near the Cardiff position as ""absolute nonsense"" but admitted he had received ""one or two text messages"" from friends in football advising him against replacing Mackay, who was sacked last Friday. Explaining a decision that has taken many people by surprise, in particular in Norway, Solskjaer said: ""Everything isn't exactly what it seems from the outside."" The 40-year-old said that there was no need for anyone to be concerned about whether he had made the right call to leave Molde for a club plagued by off-the-field problems this season. ""I am really looking forward to the challenge,"" said Solskjaer, who will be joined by Mark Dempsey and Richard Hartis, two former Manchester United youth coaches who worked with him at Molde. ""Whenever the manager put me on the bench [at Manchester United], I wanted to prove to him he is wrong. And if there is any doubts, don't worry, I'm coming into this with clear and open eyes, I know what I'm going into and I'm so looking forward to it. I'm going to bring my energy, enthusiasm, football knowledge … I want my team to play exciting football, we want the fans to come here and be proud of us."" legend Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is the new Cardiff City manager. See you at Old Trafford on 28 January, Ole. When it was pointed out to Solskjaer that Ferguson, whom he played under at Manchester United with such success and continues to refer to as ""gaffer"", has always said that the manager should be the most important person at a football club, the Norwegian replied: ""I agree. I am very confident that football matters, that is my matter."" BREAKING: are delighted to confirm the arrival of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as first team manager. Solskjaer stressed the importance of creating a culture at Cardiff where there is ""good dialogue"" and said that he enjoyed a ""great meeting"" with Tan at the Emirates Stadium on New Year's Day, when he watched .

Mehmet Dalman, the Cardiff chairman, said that he is ""100% convinced"" Solskjaer can make the step up to Premier League management. ""I am a fan of the way he plays football and the way he looks at the game,"" Dalman said. ""We will see much more attacking football from Ole. Also, I like the way he communicates – that, for me, is crucial in the role I play, communicating with the manager and the rest of the hierarchy all the way up to the owner. Ole ticks all those boxes."""	Football
11782	11783	Sunderland target loan signings of Kurt Zouma and Jack Rodwell 	Kurt Zouma and Jack Rodwell are on Sunderland’s summer shopping list with Lee Congerton, the club’s sporting director, hoping to secure the Chelsea centre-half and the midfielder on season-long loans. The 19-year-old Zouma, who cost Chelsea £12m from Saint-Etienne last season, is regarded as a centre-half of outstanding potential. José Mourinho is understood to be keen to loan him out next season. Zouma would offer Gus Poyet much needed defensive pace along with competition for Wes Brown and John O’Shea. The manager faces competition from Monaco for Zouma’s signature. Everton and West Bromwich Albion are also believed to be keen on Rodwell, who has struggled to make an impact at City after leaving Goodison Park. He would help fill the gap at the Stadium of Light created by Jack Colback’s defection to Newcastle United.	Football
14176	14177	Yes or no, Scots will 'just get on with it', says Scotland's first billionaire 	"Scottish business will ""just get on with it"" whatever its people decide on independence, according to Ayrshire-born tycoon Sir Tom Hunter who is backing a fund to support entrepreneurial start-ups. Hunter is contributing £700,000 to a £3.2m fund also backed by the Royal Bank of to help an initiative set up by the Scottish government in 2012 continue until the end of 2017. It will offer grants and loans to businesses selected via a Dragons Den-style pitching process. ""There is a funding gap for these early stage businesses. The banks are not filling it and we can't expect them to do it as this is the riskiest part of finance,"" said Hunter. He believes the help is necessary because ""Scotland lags behind in terms of starting and growing businesses and that is an important part of economic progress."" But asked if things might be better under an independent Scotland Hunter said: ""I think that's a hard question to answer. It's a step into the unknown. Whatever the people decide we'll just get on with it. That's democracy."" Hunter has refused to reveal how he will vote in the referendum on whether Scotland should break away from the rest of the UK on 18 September. Instead he has funded a and ebook which collate information from experts on the pros and cons of independence. ""I'm not going to come down on one side, I am playing this straight. I'm not involved in any of the campaigns. For the past 25 years I have been banging the drum for helping Scottish businesses: this (fund) is part of that. If any side tried to make politicial gain out of it I would be very annoyed,"" he said. The new cash from Hunter and RBS will help develop the Scottish Edge fund which has so far support 69 start-up businesses. The Scottish government has already committed £2.35m to the project. But Hunter said that successful applicants would get more than just cash – they will also get advice and mentoring from experienced business people including him. Hunter has certainly seen both the highs and lows of entrepreneurial enterprise having made his name as Scotland's first billionaire after building up and selling on the retail chain Sports Division for a quarter of a million pounds before building a portfolio of property investments and stakes in a string of retailers including Wyevale Garden Centre and fashion chain USC and footwear store Office. But he lost an estimated quarter of his fortune during the financial crisis as several of those businesses got into financial difficulties. ""I made big mistakes and I take full responsibility. I was never on my knees but my pride took a hit and I'm now a bit poorer and a lot wiser,"" he says. ""Anybody who says the entrepreneurial journey is a straight curve upwards only is wrong. It's a roller coaster and if I couldn't deal with it myself then I wouldn't be much of a man."" Having made his name and much of his fortune from retail, the entrepreneur now doesn't own any store chains, having sold his stake in the House of Fraser department store to Newcastle United and Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley in a controversial move in April this year. Ashley still owns the 11% stake as the sale of the business to Chinese conglomerate Sanpower is yet to be finalised. The deal is thought to be awaiting Chinese regulatory approval. ""It was very straightforward. I checked if I could sell my shares, I could sell them and I got paid. The rest of the shareholders haven't got paid yet. There was a lot of talk about a legal wrangle but nothing ever came of it,"" said Hunter. His main investments now are in retail software company OrderDynamics as well as property investments including a portfolio floated on London's junior Aim market in June this year."	Business
307	308	EU contribution: Cameron will have to pay up, says Farage 	 has claimed that David Cameron will be forced to pay out an extra £1.7bn into the EU budget by the end of next month despite the government saying the extra demand was not acceptable. The Ukip leader’s comments, which he says is a reflection of Britain’s impotence in , will increase the pressure on the prime minister following Thursday night’s disclosure that Britain has been ordered to pay the money because its economy is performing better than other EU economies. A government source said the demand was “not acceptable”. It remained unclear on Friday morning whether the British government would challenge the EU demand in the courts,an option the Dutch government is reportedly exploring. But on an LBC radio phone-in on Friday morning, Farage said Cameron would have little option but to go along with the demand, which will have to be paid in December. “Of course he will pay up. These are the rules, the contributions to the was a very complex formula and part of it is a measurement of your GDP against everybody else’s. There’s nothing he can do,” he said. But prominent Tory critics of Europe continued to demand that Cameron makes a stand. Conservative backbencher John Redwood said the surcharge “offended all our principles of natural justice and fair taxation”. “It is a very large increase in tax on the British people charged retrospectively without their agreement,” he told Radio 4’s Today programme. He suggested the UK should simply refuse to pay the extra amount and that parliament should be asked to pass a law declaring the payment illegal. “The British people will not want to send another £1.7bn to the European Union by a very big majority and so the British government just says it won’t pay,” he said. Tory Eurosceptic Mark Pritchard said Cameron should consider bringing forward a referendum on whether the UK should leave the EU, which the prime minister has promised in 2017. British and European commission officials confirmed that the Treasury had been told last week that budget contribution calculations based on gross national income (GNI) adjustments carried out by Eurostat, the EU statistics agency, had exposed a huge discrepancy between what Britain had been asked to contribute and what it should be paying, because of the UK’s recovery. The bombshell, , was dropped into the middle of an EU summit in Brussels where Cameron and 27 other leaders were mired in tough negotiations over climate-change policy and attempts to agree big reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. A Downing Street source said: “It’s not acceptable to just change the fees for previous years and demand them back at a moment’s notice. The European commission was not expecting this money and does not need this money and we will work with other countries similarly affected to do all we can to challenge this.” The prime minister on Thursday evening conferred with Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, as the Netherlands has also been ordered to pay more than €600m extra into the budget, while other countries such as Germany and France are likely to have excess contributions returned. The commission told the various countries of the revamped figures on 17 October, EU officials said. They said the British had until 1 December to provide €2.1bn, roughly a fifth of the UK’s annual net contribution to the EU. The demand for the money is political dynamite for a prime minister wrestling with dilemmas over Britain’s future in Europe and broadly seen to be making increasingly Eurosceptic gestures to the restless backbenchers who want to deal with Nigel Farage’s Europe rejectionists. “The timing is far from ideal,” said Patrizio Fiorilli, spokesman for the EU budget commissioner. “But there are rules we have to follow.” “It’s crazy,” said Richard Corbett, a Labour MEP and former senior EU official. “This must be an automatic thing because politically the timing could not be worse.” The request for the money comes as Cameron and his party, under pressure from Ukip to bolster their anti-EU credentials, are embroiled in fights with Brussels and other EU capitals over freedom of movement and immigration within the EU, and over Cameron’s insistence on rewriting the terms of Britain’s EU membership before putting a new deal to an in-out referendum by 2017 if he wins a second term next year. Cameron has set great store on campaigning to reduce the overall EU budget, arguing that at a time of austerity and spending cuts all across Europe, the Brussels pot could not remain immune. Eurostat arrived at the €2.1bn figure on the basis of new methods of calculating member states’ GNI since 1995, taking account of previously unreported or under-reported black economy elements, such as drug-dealing and consumption or the sex industry. Eurostat concluded that the UK economy has been doing much better than previously assumed since 1995, relative to other European countries, and that British contributions needed to be upped. “It changes the way contributions to the budget are calculated,” said Fiorilli. “Some member states have booming economies. Everyone can see the UK is growing much faster than others.” Fiorilli said that the commission and Eurostat use 1995 as the benchmark year for calculating the impact of GNI figures. “Member states including Britain insisted on this. It is their decision,” he said. The demand comes as part of what is known in Brussels as an amending budget proposal, a routine event that occurs regularly and is dependent on the ebb and flow of payments into the EU machine. There are a further six amending budgets on the table in Brussels, some of which may entail returning funds to Britain, meaning the overall bill could yet be cut. While the €2.1bn bill is theoretically due by 1 December, the amending budget also has to be endorsed by the 28 governments of the EU and by the European parliament, meaning it could run into resistance if Britain is able to marshal enough allies and given that there are many European governments reluctant to hand an easy victory to those campaigning to take the UK out of the EU.

13635	13636	Hugo Lloris signs new five-year contract with Tottenham Hotspur 	France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris has signed a new five-year contract with Tottenham. The 27-year-old joined the North London club from Lyon two summers ago. A statement on Spurs’ website read: “We are delighted to announce that Hugo Lloris has committed his future to the club with the signing of a new five-year contract.” “I spoke with the chairman [Daniel Levy] and I know the club is as ambitious as ever,” said Lloris. “It’s very important to feel at home at a club and for my family to feel well. I enjoy a great relationship with the club and the fans. “The arrival of Mauricio Pochettino is important as well. I have a good feeling with him. He is also ambitious. “Everything is clear in my head and if I’ve signed a new contract it’s because I trust the club and I’m sure we will progress in a positive way. “Last season wasn’t the season we all hoped for but we were still able to finish sixth in the league. We know where we have to improve, the club also knows and there is a feeling and a confident connection between the club and the players.” Lloris has made 78 appearances for Tottenham since joining for €10m from Lyon, potentially rising to €15m (£8m rising to £12m).

1041	1042	US jobs dip quells fears of interest rate increase 	"Fears of an early rise in US interest rates were eased on Friday by weaker than expected jobs data, helping to pull global markets out of the tailspin they had endured in another volatile week of trading. But despite a recovery from their worst levels, shares still recorded a second day of declines. Both the UK and US markets have now fallen into negative territory for the year, after testing new highs not so long ago. Stronger than expected US growth figures on Wednesday, which showed second quarter GDP up 4% on an annualised basis, along with hawkish comments from US Federal Reserve board member Charles Plosser, had prompted fears that the central bank may increase the cost of borrowing sooner than expected. Plosser objected to the guidance in the Fed's latest statement saying interest rates would remain low ""for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends"". At the current rate, the monthly bond buying would be finished before the end of the year. But Friday's non-farm payroll numbers from the US showed 209,000 jobs were created in July, lower than the bumper 298,000 the previous month and fewer than forecasts of about 230,000. This was the sixth consecutive month of 200,000 plus employment growth, the first time this has happened since 1997. But the unemployment rate rose unexpectedly from 6.1% to 6.2%, while average earnings, a figure carefully watched by the Fed for its inflationary impact, were flat at 2% year on year compared to expectations of 2.3%. These slightly weaker than expected numbers suggested the Fed would be in no rush to raise rates from their current level of close to zero, and gave some support to battered share prices. James Knightley at ING Bank said: ""As the pool of available labour continues to shrink we will see wages respond positively and inflation pressures within the economy will build. Consequently, we look for the Federal Reserve's commentary to gradually shift in the months ahead and favour a rate hike early in the second quarter of 2015."" Sean Lynch at Wells Fargo bank told Reuters: ""The worry was that bad news would be bad for the market and good news would be bad for the market and we came right down the middle with this report. It still points to a job market and an economy that is improving, but we also have the absence of wage pressures building which [was] becoming another concern for investors."" Markets have suffered a turbulent few days, hit by a combination of rate rise concerns and growing geopolitical worries. The week saw Argentina defaulting for the second time in 12 years, while continuing tensions with Russia over the Ukraine led to the imposition of further sanctions which could hit businesses and put the brakes on global growth. According to Reuters, about 40 European blue-chip companies derive more than 5% of their revenues from the Russian market. The violence in Gaza also added to the sense of events escalating out of control. In Europe the troubled Portuguese bank Espirito Santo reported a quarterly loss of €3.6bn (£2.8bn), prompting talk of a possible emergency fundraising or state bailout and leading to its shares being suspended. The losses revived worries about possible contagion in the rest of the eurozone banking sector. There were also mixed July manufacturing figures on Friday, with US and Chinese manufacturing moving ahead but the UK and eurozone PMI surveys coming in below expectations. But following the US jobs figures, markets came off their worst levels. The 100 finished down 50.93 points at 6679.18 on Friday, having fallen as low as 6624. That was still a three day loss of nearly 130 points. In Europe, Germany's Dax dropped 2% while France's Cac closed down 1%. In Japan, the Nikkei fell 97 points or 0.6% on Friday, hitting a one week low although strong earnings from companies including Sony limited the damage. Meanwhile in the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down around 55 points by the time London closed. On Thursday the US index slumped more than 300 points – its worst daily performance since February – which wiped out all the gains made so far this year. It was only two weeks ago that the Dow hit a record high as the global economy seemed to be recovering and the withdrawal of central bank stimulus seemed to be proceeding according to plan. In the foreign exchange markets, the dollar slipped back against a basket of currencies as the prospect of US rate rise receded."	Business
1226	1227	Lights, camera, quick backflip: the eloquence of silent films 	"od knows how many films I've seen in my life (about one a day is my average), but I've seldom witnessed such a receptive audience as I did for the other week. Memories of all the silent films I watched during my childhood came swinging back to me; looking around, the rest of the cinema seemed to bask in a similarly rapt and innocent haze of pleasure. When it was over, they clapped as they would at the end of an exceptionally good play. Of all the many strengths of Michel Hazanavicius's film, the absence of words is the greatest. No words means no reliance on a form of communication that isn't, in fact, anything like as effective as we think. The language of gesture often says more – and it's always more passionate. It's obvious but easy to forget, even though we wonder every day why our exchanges by text and email seem so tinny and thin, why they fail to convey friendship, love or just plain amiability as warmly as we would like. Think of the reckless physicality with which the truly great movie stars put their stories across: Cary Grant, interrupting a polite compliment with a backflip in , just for emphasis. Or 's backbone, coiled like a spring as she swoops down to suck the breath from her lover's mouth as though it were honey. Or 's menacing waddle: is he an American hero or a crusty old curmudgeon? He's not letting on, and that's the point. Think of the mockingly girlish delicacy of Brando, or Monroe as she sashays down the side of the train in . Modern screen acting can seem very cerebral by comparison, and also rather corporate, as if having anything too interesting going on might upset the customers. While researching , about an eastern European immigrant who becomes a major player in Hollywood's golden age, I came across the autobiography of  , one of the founders of the British film industry. Hepworth recalled, at the age of 21, dashing up to the top-floor London workshop of the inventor Robert W Paul, the man who pioneered the projection of moving pictures on to screens in Britain. He wanted to sell the great man his newly invented electric lamp, and found himself clambering over a dozen or more Polish and Armenian Jews asleep on the stairs. These were travelling showmen, waiting for Paul's latest projectors to be delivered, so they could go back home and dazzle the peasants of the wide-flung shtetls, the Jewish communities of eastern Europe, with the wonders of cinema. I realised how deeply cinema had taken root in Yiddish popular culture before the first world war. And then how profoundly Yiddish culture had influenced American film, as the Hollywood movie moguls, almost all of them Jewish immigrants, transformed the plays, vaudeville acts, folk tales and sentimental musical comedies they remembered from the old country into an American art form. They then presented it, in true democratic fashion, coast to coast, in palatial theatres glowing with chandeliers and marble staircases, to rich and poor alike for a mere 25 cents admission. What were the stories these moguls told? Girl meets boy, they lose each other, they get back together. Corny? Sure, but that's how it is in peasant life and, come to think of it, that's how it is everywhere else. What else? A mixed-up young man clashes with his traditionally minded parents: a perennial theme in Jewish literature, as the cultural gap between city and shtetl grew wider. Any movie examples? Too many to count. And a popular tale from 19th-century Yiddish pulp fiction: a shtetl plagued by crooks and assassins is rescued by a man of exceptional courage who draws his gun and drives the baddies away. That's right: High Noon is a Jewish movie. The first talking film was , paradoxically not really a talkie at all, but a glorious silent-and-talkie piece of Yiddish schmaltz: after that, silent movies were dead. But my cinema-buff uncle Geoff, a stalwart of the Cape Town Film Society, went on showing them to my family throughout my childhood. Not all of them were as good as they were cracked up to be. The I found faintly malodorous: all those tacky moonbound trains and weird homunculi – and weren't the illusions merely stop-go camerawork? Even I could work that out, and I was only six. Chaplin was fine as long as he was funny; when he simpered, I blushed and looked away. Buster Keaton's cool and classical style was a lot more like it. , even in a tattered old print, was astonishing, and hypnotic in its beauty. I remember my mother's voice ringing through the darkness: ""Should Nicky really be watching this?"" I'm glad I did. Travelling Light, a new play by Nicholas Wright, opens on 18 January at the National , London SE1, nationaltheatre.org.uk. There will be a live cinema broadcast on 9 February"	Film
4041	4042	Government borrowing edges up in February 	"A rise in local authority borrowing pushed up the government deficit by £9.3bn last month, but left George Osborne's deficit reduction plan on track, according to official figures. The Office for National Statistics said that for the first 11 months of the 2013/14 financial year borrowing was down £4.4bn on the same months last year to £99.3bn. Coming days after the chancellor said the public finances would be in surplus by 2018-19, the latest monthly data showed the Treasury remains on course to hit its borrowing target of £107.8bn when the financial year ends in April. Osborne said better than expected growth in the next couple of years would close the public spending deficit – the difference between tax income and government spending – at a faster rate than predicted last year. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the figures represented mixed news for . He said the underlying improvement in February was undermined by comparison with February 2013, when the shortfall was limited by a £2.3bn transfer from the sale of 4G mobile phone licences. ""To meet his revised PSNBR [public sector net borrowing requirement] target of £107.8bn in 2013-14, the chancellor now needs the shortfall to come in at £8.5bn in March. This may prove difficult to achieve, given that there was a deficit of £11.4bn in March 2013,"" he said."" ""If the chancellor immediately just misses his newly set targets for 2013-14, it could increase scepticism that the chancellor will achieve his fiscal targets further out. The latest public finances highlight the fact that there is still an awfully long way to go in getting the public finances into decent shape."" Analysts dismissed the rise in council borrowing, saying it was a figure that would normally be spread over several months, but said concerns remained that cuts in public sector spending relied on . Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said it was worrying that tax receipts were still not responding to the economic recovery as positively as might have been hoped."

3614	3615	Melancholia – review 	"oody Allen once said: ""If I had to live my life again I'd do everything the same, except that I wouldn't see ."" By the same token, if I was told that the end of the world was nigh, I wouldn't waste my time seeing , Lars von Trier's celebration of the imminent extinction of planet Earth. I'd do something more pleasurable like taking an axe to a cigarette machine and smoking my first fag for 40 years, an activity I still associate with movie-going. However, I did nearly end my own life last Tuesday by the exertion entailed in walking from the eastern side of Covent Garden to the western end of Soho in 10 minutes, due to the distributors' bad planning of the press viewings. Breathing what seemed like my last, I slumped down a couple of minutes into the apocalyptic prologue of . Fortunately I'd read that this highly stylised pre-credit sequence introduced the principal characters and presented a collision between the wandering planet and our own, resulting in a one-nil victory for the visitors. A younger critic kindly stayed behind to describe in some detail what I might have missed, even telling me that there was a reference he knew I'd have noticed to . What then followed was two chapters named ""Justine"" and ""Claire"" after the sisters at its centre, who view each other with mutual loathing. Like most of von Trier's films since he burst on the international scene at the 1984 Cannes festival with , is in English rather than his native Danish, though it doesn't seem remotely like a British or American picture, despite the appearance of familiar English-speaking actors among the assorted Scandinavians. Moreover, like his oeuvre as a whole, it is, to quote the most famous, most melancholy of Danes, ""sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought"". Indeed like Hamlet, von Trier is a depressed, attention-seeking malcontent, forever insulting and playing malevolent games with those around him and inventing dramas such as Hamlet's ""The Mousetrap"", designed to disturb and expose the audience and leave it in a state of disarray. The film is set in an unnamed country at a remote chateau where Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and her husband arrive two hours late for their elegant wedding reception, hosted by sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her rich, tight-fisted husband John (Kiefer Sutherland). This blighted event, where everyone is at each other's throats, backbiting and bloodletting, is clearly reminiscent of Thomas Vinterberg's , the most celebrated of movies to come out of the much publicised Dogme movement that von Trier launched in the 1990s and imposed upon his Danish contemporaries. There are also echoes of Elsinore, of Marienbad, of a Sadean orgy (through the name Justine), and of the wedding reception in (Justine's father, played by , is called Dexter after CK Dexter Haven, the charming philanderer impersonated by Cary Grant in George Cukor's film). In an amusing and diverting way, the wilful, depressed Justine behaves appallingly, leaving and rejoining the party as she pleases. She urinates on a green on the surrounding golf course, has sex with a young stranger in a bunker, insults the best man (Stellan Skarsgård) who is both her new father-in-law and her employer at an advertising agency. But the carefully orchestrated festivities continue unabashed. Like the partygoers in Buñuel's , the wedding guests refuse to acknowledge the impending catastrophe. Meanwhile, the soaring romantic strains of Wagner's on the soundtrack direct us to Eliot's and to thoughts of luxuriant death. The film's second half is much more like a conventional disaster movie, both of the art-house (eg Tarkovsky's ) and Hollywood (eg Stanley Kramer's ) variety. Now alone and isolated on the grand country estate, Claire, John, their young son, Leo, and Justine confront, affect to confront or merely witness the approaching Melancholia which from once being a distant speck is now emerging over the horizon like some beautiful leviathan. Claire lays into suicide pills. The rational amateur astronomer John assures everyone that the danger will pass. Leo views the planet as another marvel of nature. Justine, however, emerging from her torpor to discover a new composure, seems to welcome the collision as bringing a fitting end to an evil, isolated, unnecessary world. At one eloquent point she rearranges a display of art books in the chateau's library to give prominence to reproductions of Edward Burne-Jones's and several Bruegel paintings, among them the chilly . There are a few striking images here, especially of the sisters out riding on fine horses, observed from a high angle through an early-morning mist. But the movie is heavy, though without weight or gravitas – a solipsistic, narcissistic, inhuman affair. And it is wholly devoid of humour, except perhaps for the meeting towards the end of Claire and Justine: the game is over and they're at a golf hole bearing a flag apocalyptically marked ""19"". Superficially, resembles Terrence Malick's e in its apparent engagement with big spiritual issues and matters eschatological, but it lacks Malick's emotional generosity."	Film
1660	1661	Magic in the Moonlight review – a Woody vehicle with serious engine trouble 	agic in the Moonlight isn’t Woody Allen’s worst film – that is still probably , from 2002 – but it’s still desperately disappointing after the glorious triumph that was , last year’s Oscar-winning smash about the cantankerous bankrupt socialite, played by Cate Blanchett. That was authentic Woody Allen, the real deal. There is, on the other hand, something unreal and absent about this lacklustre 1920s period picture, which clunks and clanks along on autopilot, with vague borrowings from PG Wodehouse, Agatha Christie and indeed Woody Allen’s own earlier work. Here, his male and female leads take romantic cover from a storm in an observatory: a throwback to the rainswept Woody and Diane Keaton rushing into the planetarium in Manhattan. Like the period automobile roadster that at one point in the film breaks down, this movie has some pretty serious engine trouble. Or maybe the problem is that it has no engine to speak of. There are strained performances, weird empty stretches where the gags are supposed to go and some frankly very uncertain line-readings. Set against this are moments of delicacy and absurd charm, all but drowned in the film’s heavy, flavourless stew. is cast, or typecast, or miscast, as the stuffy and conceited fellow destined to fall, Darcy-ishly, for the woman of whom he very much disapproves. He is Stanley, a British professional magician who performs in the hokey Oriental stage persona of Wei Ling Soo (a name that sounds as if it is some cheeky pun, but isn’t, unless Wailing Sue counts) with silly flowing robes, fake drooping moustache and bald cap. As well as being a magician, Stanley is an atheist and rationalist, a crusading debunker of all the fraudsters and phoney seance-hucksters preying on the rich and credulous in the jazz age. One summer, Stanley ventures to the south of France, dead set on taking down a supposed spiritualist called Sophie (Emma Stone) whose apparent powers are dazzling fashionable society on the Côte d’Azur; these wealthy chumps are getting out their cheque books to fund a supposed spiritual research foundation being set up by Sophie and her hard-faced mamma (Marcia Gay Harden). But Sophie’s extraordinary telepathic abilities and beauty leave Stanley stunned. Could magic – and the magic of love – be more real than he thought? Magic has always played an important role in Woody Allen’s work, but it has always tended to be real magic. Kugelmass really can transport himself into Madame Bovary in his short story The Kugelmass Episode; characters really can come down from the screen in The Purple Rose of Cairo; Leonard really does transform, chameleon-like, to become like the people he’s talking to. In Magic in the Moonlight, Stanley wonders, dumbstruck, about the seductive or dangerous possibilities of something he anachronistically calls “magical thinking”, but Allen has long ago proved himself a master of this kind of thinking with his inspired fantasies: the prerogative of both fiction and comedy. This is a different type of story about magic, and there is no reason why a rationalist movie about tricks shouldn’t be as light and soufflé-ish as everything else. But Firth’s character is just so boorish and monotonous, charmless and unrelaxed. He’s presumably supposed to be as airy and debonair as Cary Grant. Instead, he glowers like Gordon Brown. The problem is not deciding to laugh at him or with him, it’s finding any occasion for laughter at all. Well, the mechanics of the country house mystery in which Stanley finds himself provide some amusement, and there is some diversion to be had in the final revelation. Perhaps going to a new Woody Allen film is now the nearest thing audiences in the 21st century can have to seeing a run-of-the-mill prewar studio picture. We idolise and fetishise the great pictures from this period and forget about the fact that the dream factory churned out an awful lot of dross as well as the gold. The sheer volume of production is what increased the likelihood of excellence and this allows posterity to pick and choose the classics and forget the rest. It’s the same with . With remarkable and undimmed stamina, he just keeps making movies and I now think it’s beside the point for critics (like me) to complain about his workrate. This is his creative style. Even at its lowest ebb it still produces moments of interest. And it is capable of throwing out something like Blue Jasmine. It might still do in the future. So I am not complaining.	Film
3241	3242	TPP trade deadlock: Pacific countries near deal after biotech breakthrough 	A dozen Pacific countries have closed in on a sweeping free trade pact after a breakthrough over how long a monopoly pharmaceutical companies should be given on new biotech drugs. The issue has pitted the US, which argued for longer protections, and five other delegations which said such measures would strain national healthcare budgets and keep life-saving medicines from patients who cannot afford them. However, as befitting for negotiations that have been going on for five years, plans to announce the deal at the talks in Atlanta, Georgia on Sunday night were delayed. The last-minute hitch was caused by New Zealand’s insistence on greater access to overseas markets for its dairy exports, people involved in the talks said. “The thing that’s missing is (an agreement) on dairy market access,” one official said. US officials said a joint news conference had been postponed until early on Monday. The compromise on medicines thrashed in Atlanta would preserve Australia’s existing five-year protection period but would also offer flexibility on longer drug monopolies, potentially creating two tracks on future drug pricing within the trading bloc, a person close to the negotiations said. The terms of that compromise, hammered out after a third all-night round of negotiations between Australia and the US, still had to find support from other nations such as Chile and Peru, other people involved in the talks said. Mexican economy minister Ildefonso Guajardo said he could not reveal details of the compromise on biologics “until everyone has signed up and we are all on the same page”. But officials were increasingly confident of completing a deal that has been in negotiations for five years. Japan’s economy minister, Akira Amari, said he had called Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to notify him that a deal was within sight. The US offers 12 years of exclusivity for the clinical data used in developing drugs like cancer therapy Avastin, developed by Genentech, a division of Roche, in order to encourage innovation. Australia insisted on five years of protection to bring down drug prices more quickly. The trade pact – the Trans Pacific Partnership, or TPP – would lower tariffs and set common standards for 12 economies led by the US and Japan, which together account for 40% of global output. President Obama has pushed for a deal as a way to open markets to US exports, including financial services and pharmaceuticals. US officials have also promoted the deal as a counterweight to China and that rising power’s vision for Asia. The talks in Atlanta were extended by 24 hours to a fifth day on Sunday. A handful of protesters unfurled a “Stop TPP” banner at the Westin hotel, where the talks were taking place, on Sunday morning. They were escorted away by security and police. By Saturday, the US and Japan had reached agreement in principle on trade in autos and auto parts in talks that also included Canada and Mexico. That agreement is expected to give US automakers, led by General Motors and Ford, two decades or more of tariff protection against low-cost pickup truck imports from Thailand or elsewhere in Asia, people briefed on the talks have said. But the TPP deal taking shape would also give Japan’s auto industry, led by Toyota, a freer hand to source parts from Asia, including from plants outside the TPP-zone, like China, for vehicles sold in North America. A “rule of origin” would stipulate that only 45% of a vehicle would have to be sourced from within the TPP, down from the equivalent ratio of 62.5% under Nafta, officials have said. New Zealand wants to ensure its dairy industry, dominated by Fonterra, the world’s largest dairy exporter, comes out as a clear winner in a TPP deal by opening markets like Canada, Mexico, Japan and the United States. If US trade representative Michael Froman, chair of the Atlanta talks, manages to steer them to a conclusion on Sunday, that would mark the start of a political fight to get the deal approved in the US. The Obama administration relied on Republican votes to win fast-track trade negotiating authority from Congress in July, setting up a straight yes or no vote on any deal. Many Democrats and labour groups have raised questions about what the TPP would mean for jobs in manufacturing and environmental protections. Republicans, including Senator Orrin Hatch, the powerful chairman of the Senate finance committee, have urged the administration to hold the line on intellectual property protections, including for biologic drugs.

10177	10178	Women fare better in independent films than in Hollywood, study finds 	"Female directors remain woefully underrepresented in Hollywood but , according to a new study commissioned by the Sundance film festival and Women in Film. The survey found that there has been little change in the gender balance at Robert Redford's annual showcase of indie film-making in Park City, Utah over the past decade. (This year, however, male and female directors are equally represented at the festival, which kicked off on Thursday and runs until Sunday.) Overall, women represented fewer than one-third of the 11,000 directors, writers, producers, cinematographers and editors working on the 820 narrative and documentary films that have appeared at Sundance since 2002. ""There has been no sustained or meaningful change across the last 11 years in the percentage of [female] directors or producers at the ,"" said Stacy L Smith of the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, which carried out the survey. Sundance still does far better than the mainstream film-making sphere, however. Over the same period only 4.4% of the top-grossing Hollywood films were directed by women, and a remarkable 40% of these had come through programmes organised by the Sundance Institute. The study also found that female film-makers are more likely to employ other women on their productions. Separate studies have found that female directors are more likely to feature women or girls on screen, and the subject matter for their films is likely to be less violent and feature fewer guns and less blood and gore. The Sundance survey found that women were better represented in the factual film-making sphere: they made up almost half of documentary directors at Sundance since 2002. Organisers hope to use the results of the study to create mentoring and support programmes to increase the number of women working behind the camera in US film-making. Gender disparity in film-making has long been an issue but raised its head firmly above the parapet at last year's Cannes film festival after it emerged that . Organisers later apologised for the oversight following strident criticism from French feminists and critics."	Film
3532	3533	Andy Burnham says Labour will end NHS 'fast-track' privatisation 	"A government will repeal the coalition's controversial healthcare legislation in the first year of taking power, the party's health spokesman has declared. In a barnstorming speech, greeted by whoops and cheers, to party delegates at Labour's annual conference, said that the Tory-led coalition's health reforms had placed the NHS on a fast-track to fragmentation and privatisation and that the legislation had to go. Internally there has been a debate within the party about whether these populist measures could be easily implemented. Critics point out that Tory and Liberal Democrat peers will control the Lords and would almost certainly block attempts to roll back dramatically a key coalition policy – especially if Labour ended up seeking Nick Clegg's support to run the country. However, Burnham made clear that in ""the first Queen's speech of the next Labour government we will repeal the act"". Despite the bravura performance, Burnham did not receive effusive support from Ed Miliband during the question-and-answer session that followed shadow cabinet speeches. When a delegate asked the Labour leader not to move Burnham in the presumed forthcoming reshuffle, Miliband declined to back Burnham personally, saying that he was ""four-square behind Andy's ideas"". Burnham said the coalition's plans were built upon competition and privatisation, but Labour would offer a national health and care service, based on people before profits. He said this would mean ""whole-person care"", effectively bringing together the hospitals, mental health services and social care. Burnham announced that 25 councils, of differing political persuasions, had already agreed to road-test the idea. He also proposed that the NHS would have one named contact to co-ordinate the care of elderly patients, who were being driven towards hospital in ever greater numbers because of the failure to support them, he said. This would mean, he said, ""known care staff going with [patients] on to the ward"". There had been, in the last two years, a 66% increase in the number of people aged 90 or more entering A&E departments via blue-light ambulances, Burnham said. ""That's 100,000 very frail and frightened people in the backs of ambulances speeding through our cities and towns."" But the Tories suggested that Burnham's plans would be expensive. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, warned that repealing the bill would cost the taxpayer £5.5bn a year, with another £20bn required to create a national care service. However, Burnham claimed the NHS was being privatised with huge private health firms run by people who had donated £1.5m to the Tories, winning £1.5bn in NHS contracts. He also said that savings were being made by forcing the NHS to restrict patient treatment, a policy that would necessitate people having to pay hospitals for care. In October 2012 hospitals were given the right to generate 49% of their income from private patients. Labour said freedom of information requests to hospitals had revealed a significant increase in income generated from private work in the first year of the new arrangements. In 2012/13, hospitals generated £434m, an additional £47m on 2010/11. The NHS trusts projected that this would increase by a further £45m to £479m this year. The move to make money from patients comes as Burnham claimed that one in seven GP commissioners – those who buy care on behalf of patients – had introduced new treatment restrictions. Labour advised that this was growing evidence that some patients were being unfairly denied access to vital treatments. In his speech Burnham said: ""Thousands of older people denied cataract, hip and knee operations simply because of where they live – a postcode lottery running riot. And get ready for the next scandal. NHS hospitals, pushed by David Cameron to earn half their income from private patients, charging for beds left empty by these restrictions."" The hard-hitting words clearly pleased the Labour activists at conference. Such support will be crucial for Burnham, whose position in his present post has been called in question after about the party's need to be bolder."	Politics
8748	8749	RBS chairman makes plea as £2bn loss is announced 	" pleaded to be treated as a fully commercial business as it confirmed it is paying out £785m in bonuses despite recording another loss – of £2bn – last year. As the bank announced the fourth consecutive year of losses since its October 2008 bailout, chairman Sir Philip Hampton argued that it needed to be run on ""commercial grounds"" if taxpayers were to get their £45bn investment repaid. The state is currently sitting on a £20bn loss on its 82% stake, despite the shares rising 5% to 28.2p. Even as the bank insisted that bonuses were down and attempted to show restraint by imposing salary freezes on its 17,000 investment bankers and other high-paid staff, union officials were furious at 1% salary rises for branch staff who will not share in the £390m investment banking bonus pool. The retail arm recorded a jump in profits and David Fleming, Unite national officer, accused the bank of ""hypocrisy"". ""The bonus pot would give these low-paid employees approximately £6,000, which amounts to simply loose change for a City slicker,"" Fleming said. Rival bailed out bank Lloyds Group will also report losses on Friday and face a potential row over pay if it discloses a golden hello for new finance director George Culmer, who is to join in May. RBS insisted average pay for investment bankers had fallen 26% from £152,000 to £112,000 although calculations of average staff costs inside the investment bank showed they had remained steady at £144,000 despite a 54% fall in operating profit to £1.5bn. The compensation to income ratio – which shows how much revenue is used to pay staff – rose to 41% from 34% and the Association of British Insurers argued that the ""figures make it difficult to judge"" how far RBS was sharing the spoils between employees, shareholders and to strengthen its financial position. Chris Leslie, shadow Treasury minister, accused the chancellor of doing ""nothing to change the excessive bonus culture that continues to roll on and on"". The average investment banking bonus was £22,941, more than 50% lower than £50,114 a year ago, while the bonus pool for the 146,000 staff across the group was £795m. For accounting purposes the ""variable compensation"" was £985m. Chief executive Stephen Hester said his colleagues should not hand their bonuses back as he did – and warned the ""noise"" around RBS was damaging. ""You can't have your cake and eat it,"" said Hester. ""If you want an RBS that is mired in the past, a British Leyland, then we should be judged on a different basis,"" Hester said. He defended the investment bank, saying that without the £10bn of profits it had generated in the past three years another taxpayer bailout would have been needed. The £45bn bailout had been enough to keep the bank afloat but not to cover the £42bn of clean up charges incurred so far, paid for out of £33bn of operating profits, Hester said as he described an an ""Alice in Wonderland"" world in which bigger losses were proof of success as the bank wound down its balance sheet. Some £10bn of the clean-up bill comes from Ulster Bank's bad property loans. Ministers lined up in support of the pay deals, as did UK Financial Investments which controls the taxpayer stake. George Osborne said RBS was""cleaning up the mess after the biggest bank bailout in history"" and that ""bonuses at the investment bank are less than half what they were last year and less than a third of what they were in 2009"". Hampton admitted that ministers had been warned by ""many sources"" about the impact of anti-business rhetoric and not just on RBS. Hester revised down targets for return on equity from 15% to 12% but stressed that many other targets he set when he took the helm three years ago had been achieved, such as reducing the balance sheet by £700bn – which he described as twice the size of Greece's debt."

8126	8127	George Osborne accused of con trick over £1.7bn EU bill 	 did not raise a single complaint about Britain’s £1.7bn EU backdated bill and did not manage to get a single penny off the total, Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, has said. Balls said it was a con trick that took the British people for fools, after the chancellor claimed to have reduced the bill to £850m at an EU meeting on Friday by negotiating to make sure the UK’s rebate applied. Balls also joked that he could barely see John Bercow, the Speaker, for all Osborne’s “fog and bluster”, because it was always obvious that the UK would get its usual discount on the bill. A from the European budget commissioner on 27 October proves the rebate was always going to apply and was never in doubt, Balls said. Addressing the chancellor, Balls said: “Isn’t the truth the chancellor has failed to reduce our contribution by a single penny? “All he is doing is simply counting the rebate that was due anyway, a rebate that was never in doubt, trying to fool people into thinking the bill has been halved. His so-called victory is nothing more than a con trick.” He said minutes from the EU meeting showed Osborne did not object to the bill and questioned Treasury claims that the chancellor had received legal advice casting doubt on whether the rebate would be applied. But Osborne pointed out that Balls did not mention the application of the discount when the latter, in an , set out the sum that the UK would have to pay, along with interest payments based on the £1.7bn total. Posing in the Commons with a copy of the newspaper, the chancellor said it was “not clear” before the meeting that the rebate would apply, reducing the total to £850m. “If it was the case that was always going to apply, why was it not mentioned before?” he said. Osborne said the UK’s bill had been halved from £1.7bn, had been delayed until 2015-16 and would include no interest. The chancellor was backed by supportive Tory MPs. But the pro-Europe former cabinet minister Ken Clarke cast doubt on the idea that the chancellor had won a great battle. He said it was a “surprisingly good” deal but probably the result of a friendly chat rather than “gunfight at the OK Corral”.	Politics
3744	3745	Labour extends lead over Tories to 11 points, according to new poll 	 has stretched its lead over the Tories to 11 points, according to a new Opinium/Observer poll. The poll puts Labour on 38%, the Conservatives on 27%, and the on 9%. The Tories have dropped four points in two weeks, and David Cameron's personal popularity is now almost on a par with that of . That will be a particular tonic for the Labour leader, who has consistently suffered in comparisons with Cameron. According to the poll, 33% of respondents approve of Cameron, and 51% disapprove. That compares with 25% who approve of Miliband, and 44% who disapprove. Opinium Research has also carried out polling on the public's attitude to free schools. Last week the row over the al-Madinah free school in Derby continued after Ofsted found the school dysfunctional and teachers claimed they were forced to wear a hijab. Despite the headlines, 44% of likely voters in England think free schools are generally a good thing, while 22% think they're a bad thing. However, 60% are concerned about free schools hiring teachers who may not have a PGCE or equivalent, while 30% are not. Views on the future of free schools are fairly mixed. Nearly a quarter (23%) think they should continue as they are, while 27% think they should continue only if there is a shortage of places in local schools and all teachers have a PGCE or equivalent. One in five believe that free schools should no longer be funded and existing ones should be taken under local authority control. Opinium Research carried out an online survey of 1,936 British adults aged 18 and over from 15 to 18 October 2013. Results have been weighted to nationally representative criteria.

12162	12163	Steven Gerrard vows to return to Liverpool in the future 	 has pledged to return to Liverpool because he feels he has a contribution to make to the club in the future. The 34-year-old is enjoying a post-season break before he begins a new challenge in Major League Soccer with Los Angeles Galaxy this summer. But after 710 appearances in a 17-year professional career at Anfield, Gerrard has his sights set on coming back. “I’ve been a supporter all my life and that will continue,” he wrote in an open letter to fans in the Echo. “I hope to get the opportunity to come back and serve the club again one day. I feel that I can make a contribution in some role in the future.” Gerrard has been captain for more than a decade and led from the front in most of the club’s recent successes, most famously . However, this season he has not featured as regularly as he would have liked and that persuaded him a move to the United States would help prolong his playing career despite a contract offer coming in late from the Reds. “I want to keep playing every week in the final few years of my career and I’m looking forward to embarking on a new challenge with Los Angeles Galaxy in the MLS,” he added. “It’s been an absolute privilege to represent this football club for so long. It’s been very humbling and it’s something I’ll cherish for the rest of my life. “People have often asked me about the pressure on my shoulders to deliver for Liverpool but I’ve never seen that as a burden. It’s been a massive honour to be captain of this club for so long. I’ve always given my best and tried to lead by example.” He added: “But today is all about looking back and saying thank you to the fans for the magnificent support you have given me over the past two decades. You have helped me to fulfil my dreams over and over again and given me memories I wouldn’t swap for anything.”	Football

7668	7669	Harman seeks to end Labour row with ‘reasoned amendment’ to welfare bill 	Labour’s interim leader, , has tried to defuse a rebellion over welfare by tabling an amendment setting out why the party disagrees with the government’s proposed bill, but suggesting that Labour MPs abstain rather than vote against. Labour has been plagued by infighting since Harman that the party would not block the bill but would instead try to amend parts of it at committee stage. The decision to table a “reasoned amendment” came after Helen Goodman, the MP for Bishop Auckland, tabled a backbench amendment opposing the bill. It also followed further talks with the new intake of MPs on Wednesday night and again with at least 10 shadow cabinet ministers on Thursday. The amendment, setting out why the bill should be rejected, was put forward by Harman in an effort to prevent the party from splitting on an issue that has been made more difficult as leadership candidates try to signal their positions while retaining collective shadow cabinet responsibility. The frontrunner for the leadership, , this week called for the party to oppose the welfare bill if a reasoned amendment was defeated. Burnham met Harman on Thursday afternoon and is understood to be pleased that such a motion is being proposed, but his aides refused to disclose whether he would then oppose the bill rather than abstain, if the amendment was defeated. Aides to , the shadow home secretary and a leadership rival to Burnham, also said she clearly opposed the bill, but insisted they would not brief on how the party should vote if the amendment is defeated. Another shadow cabinet meeting may be needed to thrash out a final position after party whips have taken further soundings. An already-demoralised party can hardly afford a big split on welfare with different leadership candidates voting different ways. Any divisions will be exploited by George Osborne, who is intent on portraying as the party of welfare as opposed to a Conservative party committed to work. Harman at the weekend said Labour needed to wake up and understand the reasons for its defeat, including public rejection of the party’s stance on the economy and welfare. She said abstention on the welfare bill would be a signal that the party was prepared to change. Her stance led to a rebellion in the parliamentary party, and she clearly hopes she has crafted a compromise that sets out the party’s reasoned differences with the government without lapsing into a blanket opposition that gives the impression Labour is not willing to reflect and change. The reasoned amendment calls for controls on and reforms to the overall costs of social security and supports the proposed reporting obligations on full employment, apprenticeships and troubled families in the bill as well as a benefits cap and loans for mortgage interest support. But it says the house should not give the bill a second reading since it would “prevent the government from continuing to pursue an ambition to reduce child poverty in both absolute and relative terms”. Harman will also propose that the party go out and listen to the public on welfare reform, including on the proposal that tax credits should only be provided to the first two children. She retains her position that the party needs to recognise that many people in work, and not on tax credits, limit their family size for financial reasons and will resent it if they believe the same financial constraints are not being placed on those on benefits. Helen Goodman, the leader of the backbench rebels, said she welcomed Harman’s decision to table an amendment but added: “I cannot see why if you table a reasoned amendment rejecting a bill you would then go onto abstain in a further vote on the bill. It would be best to oppose all the way through because of the damage the bill does to people in poverty.” Harman’s stance has created tensions in the context of the Labour leadership election with some Burnham supporters believing she was trying to portray him as an opponent of reform. But she is understood to feel strongly that she consulted the relevant shadow cabinet colleagues and insists she has no other motive than reflecting a recognition of the public mood. Meanwhile Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign, still surging in terms of constituency nominations, hit trouble when one of his prominent young supporters claimed if Corbyn won he would have to act swiftly to purge staff at the party headquarters and bring the parliamentary party into line. Max Shanly, a Corbyn supporter on the national committee of Young Labour and active in Unite, saying: “I think Jeremy will face problems not just inside the parliamentary Labour party, which I think is likely to split if he wins with the Blairites buggering off to form a new SDP, but also from the Labour party bureaucracy. New Labourism is still a hegemonic force at Brewers Green (Labour Party HQ) and despite having resigned as leader eight years ago, Blair is still the piper who plays the tune many party staff listen to. “The Labour left will have to act swiftly and I am afraid brutally in many cases. The PLP will have to be brought into line, some members of party staff will need to be pointed towards the exit, and the entire party structures would, in my opinion, need to undergo a comprehensive and thorough review. On the latter point, essentially we need the sweeping away of the current party form.” He added: “It would not be wrong to describe Jeremy as the Bennite continuity candidate, but with the advantage that the ideas Benn espoused and others worked for have finally seen their time come.”	Politics
568	569	Nestlé agrees to pay all employees living wage 	"Food giant Nestlé has become the first leading manufacturer to commit to paying the living wage. The firm already pays at least the living wage to its 8,000 staff but the move will benefit contract employees and agency workers. About 800 contractors working with Nestlé will implement it by December 2017. The announcement was described by campaigners as a significant milestone in the drive to persuade employers to pay the living wage, which is currently set at £8.80 an hour in London and £7.65 elsewhere, compared to the national minimum wage of £6.31. Nestlé UK & Ireland's chief executive, Fiona Kendrick, said: ""We are proud to be the first mainstream manufacturer in the UK to become a living wage employer and see this as an opportunity to be a positive influence in our sector. ""As a major UK employer, we know that this is the right thing to do. Not only does it benefit our employees but also the communities they live and work in."" Living Wage Foundation director Rhys Moore said: ""The accreditation of Nestlé as a living wage employer marks a significant milestone in the campaign to tackle in-work poverty. We hope that the leadership they have shown will encourage others in this industry to follow suit and improve conditions for those at the lowest end of the pay scale and sub-contracted staff. ""We are aware that Nestlé is going above and beyond the basic requirements of becoming an accredited employer, and is extending their commitment to graduate, internship and school leaver programmes."" Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, said: ""With in-work poverty on the rise, many employers are simply ignoring their responsibility to pay staff a decent wage. They should take note from Nestlé's positive stance which shows that paying a living wage is not just good for communities but makes good business sense too."" Tim Roache, of the GMB union, said: ""Nestlé have always recognised their greatest asset is their workforce and are demonstrating this with action, not just words. This shows once and for all that if one leading manufacturer can pay a living wage to all employees including young workers and those contracted out, then many more are able to do so."" The business secretary, Vince Cable, said: ""I welcome Nestlé's decision and encourage all businesses to pay their staff above the minimum wage when it is affordable and not at the expense of jobs."" The shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, said: ""It is fantastic news that Nestlé is announcing its accreditation as a living wage employer, having worked in collaboration with Unite, GMB and the Living Wage Foundation to achieve this. ""We want to see as many businesses as possible take the decision to become living wage employers, so I hope other firms will follow the strong example which Nestlé is setting."""	Business

3425	3426	Quarter flounder: McDonald's sales continue to fall for 12th straight month 	The much-heralded McDonald’s turnaround may be working – despite another monthly fall in sales. On Monday, the fast-food giant revealed that for a 12th straight month, same-restaurant sales around the world were down. The 0.3% drop, however, exceeded expectation. Analysts expected a decline of 0.9%. The figures were mainly achieved thanks to a 2.3% increase in sales in Europe. In the US, sales continued to drop – restaurants open at least 13 months reported a 2.2% fall. Starting in July, McDonald’s will stop reporting its sales on monthly basis.

9560	9561	Sam Adams founder: Beer is more than just 'cold, fizzy and in a can' 	"The craft beer boom, which and been attributed to millennials, has been kind to brewers like Samuel Adams, which have been brewing craft beers for the past 30 years – when millennials weren't even born. The increasing interest in craft beers hasn’t gone unnoticed by beer giants like MillerCoors and Anheuser-Busch. As a result, the two companies have tried their hands at scooping up a part of the market for themselves – MillerCoors’ with Blue Moon and Anheuser-Busch with Shock Top. Their efforts haven’t been for nothing. , Shock Top is the fastest growing craft beer. Similarly, in the last four years. And while many fans of real craft beers – – argue that those , semantics matter little when it comes to sales. It’s hard to compete with companies like that when it comes to production, admits Jim Koch, founder of Boston Beer Company, which brews Samuel Adams beers. Boston Beer Company has 1,000 employees and , meaning they are to beer what sommeliers are to wine. Koch talks about making beer for creativity, quality and taste – throwing in rose hips and other garden-scented ingredients into a spring beer and expanding product offerings. Sam Adams is also expanding beyond beer into hard cider and malt beverages, which consumers have been demanding more, , a beverage industry analyst for Standard and Poor’s. In response, Samuel Adams started producing , which became the country's top-selling cider only eight months after it launched, and a hard iced tea called Twisted Tea. For now, of the beer market. To find out more about life at Sam Adams, we caught up with him to chat about everything from micro-brewing to micro-lending to being a bridesmaid. It's surprising. You know when I started Sam Adams 30 years ago, even the term ""craft beer"" did not exist. If you told me [then] that in 30 years, American craft brewers would have changed the landscape – not only in United States, but set a model for craft brewing in the rest of the world – I would have been stunned. Craft beer is in a middle of a boom in the US. In a declining US beer industry, craft beer grew 20% last year. When I started, my business plan was that it would take five years to grow to 5,000 barrels, which was about $1m in revenue and eight employees, and then it would level off. I was horribly wrong, but horribly wrong in a right direction. Well, Sam Adams has become the leading craft brewer, one of the original pioneers. To me, a lot of the fun is to continue pioneer new beers and other innovations like cider. Last year, we put in a nano brewery in Boston to be able to do 10-gallon batches of beer and to continue to experiment with beer styles, new brewing techniques, new ingredients in beer. We had a really successful this year that had rose hips, powdered plums, hibiscus, anise, vanilla, tamarind, grains of paradise, lemon zest, coriander, orange peel. I think that the continuing hallmarks of Sam Adams in particular and craft beer in general are creativity and innovation. It's pretty interesting. Most people don't know this, but my background is in manufacturing and quality control. I was a manufacturing consultant for Boston Consulting Group, BCG, for almost seven years. I enjoyed it. I learned a lot about business and after six years, I guess, I wasn't learning that much more about business, I was learning about how to be a consultant, and I didn't want to be a consultant for the rest of my life. So when I realized that, I told BCG that I wanted to leave and I didn't want to work for a big corporation. I've seen them in my years as a consultant and it just wasn't a place that I wanted to go. I saw the dysfunctions of big corporations and I really didn't want to be part of that. I decided that I would start my own company – I just didn't know what at first. I thought about a lot of things and kept coming back to brewing. And again, there were no craft beers back then. There was no role model for success, but it was something that I was passionate about. I am actually the sixth oldest son in a row to be a brewer. So, there was a certain pull from that family history and it just all came together. It seemed that it was going to be something that would be really challenging, but worthwhile. We are selling higher quality beers and in order to do that you gotta have more highly trained people who can describe to the consumer the quality and character of the beer. This has been true since the beginning, because I sold the beer myself for most of the company's history. What I soon realized was that I wasn't just offering a physical product, I had to educate people about quality and taste in beer and where it came from and what the ingredients were and what the style was. [I had] to teach people to think about beer differently than cold, fizzy and in a can, which was the way people thought about beer when I started. I learned early on that I was not just providing product, a beer; I needed to provide beer education and tradition. At that point, my original investors had been in for over a decade and had not seen any return on their investment. My investors were not institutions – [they were] drinking buddies, some relatives. And they have seen no return on their investment even though the company had been successful, so going public was a way for them to get a return on their investment, but for me to continue to keep control of it, because I have all the voting shares. Not so much, because I still have all the voting shares so I still have control. Being public has its plusses and minuses. One of the plusses is increased transparency, which is not a bad thing for a company. Because of the voting shares, I can focus on long-term success and value creation. I don't have to worry about quarterly earnings, even annual earnings, because nobody can fire me. It's a little different that way – I can focus on long-term value creation. To me, you should be innovative about all the important things that you do. Frankly, I was a little naive, but I thought public offering meant that the shares went to the public. And when the bankers described the process to me, I realized: ""Oh, no, the public can't really get shares."" Particularly, if it's a good deal. Institutions get the shares and then the public gets to buy them at a mark-up. I think we were the first ones to do this – we put coupons on six packs and we sold shares . So the public actually got the lower price and the investment banks were … ah, didn't want to do that. They were arm-twisting about truly letting the public in to the public offering and a lot of those people still hold shares, almost 20 years later. Those are the kind of investors you want. That was just fun. I got to be a bridesmaid. I was a bridesmaid three times. Truly, I am always a bridesmaid, never a bride. The inspiration goes all the way back to when I went to not just Harvard Business School, but Harvard Law School. While I was there, I worked on the environmental law review and wrote an article about what was then called corporate social responsibility, making the observation that companies that seem to pay attention to that actually performed better financially. It's my belief that companies that are mindful of their larger responsibilities beyond just shareholder returns, generally perform better with their shareholders. We always had a number of philanthropic activities but they were not that satisfying to me. The one that was kind of an epiphany for me was painting a community center here. The management team went out and we spent the day working together painting a community center that needed work, but couldn't afford it. And I didn't feel really good about it, because as a business my mission is to add value. I was walking back to my car and I realized I probably spent $20,000 worth of management time to do about $2,000 worth of bad painting. That's not creating value. I felt that Boston should bring the same creativity and innovation to our philanthropic activities that we do to the rest of our business. We took a year, thought about a lot of different things with the focus on: how do we add the most value to our communities? We settled on Brewing the American Dream, which is a micro-lending and coaching and counseling program for small business in the area that we know, which is food, beverage and hospitality. That's something that we are good at and we have people who are very knowledgeable. The other part in the origin is that when I started Sam Adams, I realized there were a lot of things, nuts and bolts of business, that I didn't understand and where I made mistakes. I've got a business degree from Harvard Business School and a law degree from Harvard Law School, you'd think I would know some of this stuff. But there's just so many nuts and bolts when you start a small business and you are a CEO of everything … I knew about brewing, I was passionate about beer but I didn't know how to negotiate a real estate lease. I didn't know how to set up payroll. I didn't know how to make a sales call. I didn't know how to design a label. I didn't know how to hire PR. I could go on and on. And those are all really important things. So what we do is, in addition to the loans, we provide coaching and counseling on nuts and bolt in food, beverage and hospitality. We have sessions called speed coaching; it's a technique modeled on speed dating that we invented for this program. We got small business owners and entrepreneurs to come – here in Boston, we usually do it at the brewery – and they will sign up for 20-minute coaching sessions with six or eight different experts in the area that are relevant to their business, problems that they are struggling with. They'd go one place and talk to a guy whose expertise is procuring unusual ingredients from all over the world, because some of these entrepreneurs come up with these interesting recipes from their own cultures. Then the next place they'd go talk to somebody about how do you design a package for it. And the next place will be how do you do an interview, how do you hire people. So they get instant expertise on these areas where nuts and bolts really matter. ﻿﻿We have been making cider in the US for almost 20 years and about three years ago, we came to believe that there was an opportunity in cider that was somewhat like craft beer 30 years ago – a traditional beverage that had a lot of quality, natural ingredients, but was underrepresented in the United States. I believe cider was 0.2% of the US beer market. We've been making cider for almost 20 years, but a lot of it was playing around, experimenting with different apples. We got our technical expertise from two gentlemen who retired from , [an Irish cider maker] in the mid-90s. One was the technical director there and one was the head cider maker. So we had access to two of the world's best cider makers that trained us for 20 years and we decided to put that learning to use and developed a new cider called Angry Orchard. It has been significantly more successful than we thought and it created a lot of excitement and growth in the cider category in the US. Since we launched angry orchard, the cider category has tripled – off of a really small base. I don't know how big it's going to get. I don't know if it's going to keep growing, but it's the kind of high quality, traditional, niche product where we can bring some innovation around quality. That's going to help develop a category. That's really at the core of our mission and strategy, because as a small company – we're only over 1% of the US beer business – we can't compete on cost and efficiency with the large global brewers. They are so much better at that than we could ever be. As a result, we have to do something unique, different and something that's inherently small. If it's going to be a big category quickly, big brewers are going to be much better at it than we are. Actually, it's been not quite a year. Again, to illustrate the point, before we did that, we spent almost two years redesigning the beer can to create a better taste experience. We have that is different than the standard beer can. It has a different shape on the top and a larger, wider lid, both of which open your mouth up when you are drinking from Sam Adams can so it makes it more like drinking from a glass. Typical beverage cans, as consumer is well aware, [are] the same. Whether you are putting beer in it or diet soda or tomato juice or energy drink, every beverage can is the same. It's clearly not optimized for beer. And if you notice when you are drinking from a can, the can is designed to have as small as possible lid, because that is the cheapest can. The lid is the most expensive part, that's why cans taper in so that you get the smallest possible lid cause that will give you the cheapest can. Unfortunately, what that means for a taste experience as you drink from a standard beverage can, you essentially suck out of it. You form a seal with your mouth over the opening and suck the beverage out of it. You don't actually get the flavor experience until you pull it away from your mouth, and you get air ingress into your nasal and retro nasal passages. In Sam Adams can, the wider and hour glass shape at the top of it – so it doesn't just come in, it comes in and then it goes out. Those function to force your mouth to open as you drink from it, so you drink more slowly, but you get more taste."	Business
10801	10802	Slump in oil prices could mean fall in investment and future shortages – IEA 	The International Energy Agency has warned that the current slump in oil prices will hold back investment and could create shortages in the future as overall energy demand is forecast to grow by 37% in the next 25 years. But at the same time, the organisation, which was set up in the aftermath of previous price shocks, said that while more drilling was needed, it was still important that governments wound down the world’s $550bn (£346bn) of annual fossil fuel subsidies and switched support to renewable power. The IEA said oil and gas would play a continuing role as demand continued to rise, but that politicians should not shirk the need to tackle climate change, as the current trajectory of carbon use would leave humanity facing “a very different” world. “Today’s price level may offer some comfort to consumers but it will not last very long,” said Fatih Birol, IEA chief economist. “A well-supplied oil market in the short term should not disguise the challenges that lie ahead, as the world is set to rely more heavily on a relatively small number of producing countries.” Birol, speaking at the , said there were already signs of a 10% cut in US spending by oil companies as a result of the slump in oil prices there to $80 per barrel. This came at a time when investment in other key future crude producers such as Iraq was close to zero. American shale oil and gas had transformed the market but post-2020 the world would increasingly find itself relying on Canada, Brazil and the politically volatile Middle East for world oil supplies, he said. Birol said countries such as Russia, China and India needed to wind down their consumer-price subsidies for fossil fuels, which deterred renewable power investment, squandered valuable energy resources and gave their citizens “all the wrong messages.” The IEA estimates that wind, solar and other renewable technologies received subsidies of $121bn last year and this figure would rise to $230bn by 2030 before falling back to $205bn in 2040. The organisation hailed the performance of renewables as “incredible” and expected it to provide half of global electricity generation by 2040, with the bulk of the advances being made in China. “As our global energy system grows and transforms, signs of stress continue to emerge,” said Maria van der Hoeven, the IEA’s executive director. “But renewables are expected to go from strength to strength, and it is incredible that we can now see a point where they become the world’s number one source of electricity generation.” The IEA also gave its support to the development of new nuclear power projects, but said it was vital that governments found a permanent solution to dealing with high level radioactive waste. A separate report warned that uncertainty in the UK over subsidies for offshore windfarms had forced the industry to shelve a series of new projects. The study by the independent thinktank Green Alliance, titled , argued that without a long-term commitment, the industry would be unable to achieve the economies of scale needed to bring down costs. Energy secretary Ed Davey said this week that onshore wind power was already suffering after communities secretary Eric Pickles called in 50 planning applications. Davey said the Tory minister was undermining investor confidence in an industry that employs more than 15,000 workers.	Business
6726	6727	British Gas owner Centrica warns of higher gas costs 	"Senior executives at British have been accused of being an ""utter disgrace"" after being awarded a potentially generous pay deal just as they warned that more price rises were on the way. The attack from a member of parliament's energy and climate change committee came as a large group of shareholders voted against the remuneration report while other companies faced the latest blowback from the ""shareholder spring"". Vladimir Kim, the top shareholder in the mining firm Kazakhmys, said he would step down as chairman within 12 months, a new executive pay package at oil services group Petrofac faced opposition from shareholders and a quarter of investors rejected a remuneration report at shipbroker Clarkson. But the greatest acrimony came at , the parent group of British Gas, after it warned that it might have to increase energy bills this winter by at least £50. John Robertson, a Glasgow MP, who sits on the energy select committee, said: ""It's clear that Centrica think this is a good day to bury bad bills. The fact they chose this day to announce these price rises, when [former chief executive of News International] Rebekah Brooks is before [the] Leveson [inquiry)], shows they are an utter disgrace,"" he said. ""This government has to act to put an end to greedy gas companies taking hard-pressed customers for a ride. Pensioners in my constituency are only just getting over the budget, now they are hit with the prospect of rising energy bills."" Centrica's chief executive, Sam Laidlaw, and the British Gas managing director, Phil Bentley, were accused by one investor of presiding over an ""arrogant"" company that had been fined £2.5m for not investigating customer complaints properly. Another shareholder asked Laidlaw whether he would hand back the bonus element of his remuneration package of nearly £4m, a question that finally triggered an impassioned defence of the chief executive by Sir Roger Carr, the Centrica chairman. ""We are very fortunate to have Sam Laidlaw for this business,"" said Carr. ""For five years he has done a remarkable job for this company and one I am very proud to be associated with."" The group pay arrangements had very high hurdles in place that had to be overcome for bonus payouts to be made, he argued, but 12% of shareholders still voted against the remuneration report when it came up for approval. Both the Pension & Investment Research Consultant and the Association of British Insurers had raised concerns about the pay proposals. Meanwhile in a statement British Gas said wholesale gas prices for the forthcoming winter were about 15% higher than last year and non-commodity costs – such as transportation and environment levies – could add £50 to the cost of supplying the average household this year."

12365	12366	Ole Gunnar Solskjaer appointed manager of Cardiff City 	" is confident he will have complete control of football matters as Cardiff City's new manager and has insisted that he has no reservations about working under Vincent Tan, the club's controversial owner. Speaking on the day he was appointed as Malky Mackay's successor, Solskjaer said that he was going into the job with ""open eyes"" and with the aim of turning Cardiff into a top-10 Premier League club. The Norwegian, who has agreed a 12-month rolling contract, dismissed suggestions that Sir Alex Ferguson had told him not to go anywhere near the Cardiff position as ""absolute nonsense"" but admitted he had received ""one or two text messages"" from friends in football advising him against replacing Mackay, who was sacked last Friday. Explaining a decision that has taken many people by surprise, in particular in Norway, Solskjaer said: ""Everything isn't exactly what it seems from the outside."" The 40-year-old said that there was no need for anyone to be concerned about whether he had made the right call to leave Molde for a club plagued by off-the-field problems this season. ""I am really looking forward to the challenge,"" said Solskjaer, who will be joined by Mark Dempsey and Richard Hartis, two former Manchester United youth coaches who worked with him at Molde. ""Whenever the manager put me on the bench [at Manchester United], I wanted to prove to him he is wrong. And if there is any doubts, don't worry, I'm coming into this with clear and open eyes, I know what I'm going into and I'm so looking forward to it. I'm going to bring my energy, enthusiasm, football knowledge … I want my team to play exciting football, we want the fans to come here and be proud of us."" legend Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is the new Cardiff City manager. See you at Old Trafford on 28 January, Ole. When it was pointed out to Solskjaer that Ferguson, whom he played under at Manchester United with such success and continues to refer to as ""gaffer"", has always said that the manager should be the most important person at a football club, the Norwegian replied: ""I agree. I am very confident that football matters, that is my matter."" BREAKING: are delighted to confirm the arrival of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as first team manager. Solskjaer stressed the importance of creating a culture at Cardiff where there is ""good dialogue"" and said that he enjoyed a ""great meeting"" with Tan at the Emirates Stadium on New Year's Day, when he watched .

Mehmet Dalman, the Cardiff chairman, said that he is ""100% convinced"" Solskjaer can make the step up to Premier League management. ""I am a fan of the way he plays football and the way he looks at the game,"" Dalman said. ""We will see much more attacking football from Ole. Also, I like the way he communicates – that, for me, is crucial in the role I play, communicating with the manager and the rest of the hierarchy all the way up to the owner. Ole ticks all those boxes."""	Football
11782	11783	Sunderland target loan signings of Kurt Zouma and Jack Rodwell 	Kurt Zouma and Jack Rodwell are on Sunderland’s summer shopping list with Lee Congerton, the club’s sporting director, hoping to secure the Chelsea centre-half and the midfielder on season-long loans. The 19-year-old Zouma, who cost Chelsea £12m from Saint-Etienne last season, is regarded as a centre-half of outstanding potential. José Mourinho is understood to be keen to loan him out next season. Zouma would offer Gus Poyet much needed defensive pace along with competition for Wes Brown and John O’Shea. The manager faces competition from Monaco for Zouma’s signature. Everton and West Bromwich Albion are also believed to be keen on Rodwell, who has struggled to make an impact at City after leaving Goodison Park. He would help fill the gap at the Stadium of Light created by Jack Colback’s defection to Newcastle United.	Football
14176	14177	Yes or no, Scots will 'just get on with it', says Scotland's first billionaire 	"Scottish business will ""just get on with it"" whatever its people decide on independence, according to Ayrshire-born tycoon Sir Tom Hunter who is backing a fund to support entrepreneurial start-ups. Hunter is contributing £700,000 to a £3.2m fund also backed by the Royal Bank of to help an initiative set up by the Scottish government in 2012 continue until the end of 2017. It will offer grants and loans to businesses selected via a Dragons Den-style pitching process. ""There is a funding gap for these early stage businesses. The banks are not filling it and we can't expect them to do it as this is the riskiest part of finance,"" said Hunter. He believes the help is necessary because ""Scotland lags behind in terms of starting and growing businesses and that is an important part of economic progress."" But asked if things might be better under an independent Scotland Hunter said: ""I think that's a hard question to answer. It's a step into the unknown. Whatever the people decide we'll just get on with it. That's democracy."" Hunter has refused to reveal how he will vote in the referendum on whether Scotland should break away from the rest of the UK on 18 September. Instead he has funded a and ebook which collate information from experts on the pros and cons of independence. ""I'm not going to come down on one side, I am playing this straight. I'm not involved in any of the campaigns. For the past 25 years I have been banging the drum for helping Scottish businesses: this (fund) is part of that. If any side tried to make politicial gain out of it I would be very annoyed,"" he said. The new cash from Hunter and RBS will help develop the Scottish Edge fund which has so far support 69 start-up businesses. The Scottish government has already committed £2.35m to the project. But Hunter said that successful applicants would get more than just cash – they will also get advice and mentoring from experienced business people including him. Hunter has certainly seen both the highs and lows of entrepreneurial enterprise having made his name as Scotland's first billionaire after building up and selling on the retail chain Sports Division for a quarter of a million pounds before building a portfolio of property investments and stakes in a string of retailers including Wyevale Garden Centre and fashion chain USC and footwear store Office. But he lost an estimated quarter of his fortune during the financial crisis as several of those businesses got into financial difficulties. ""I made big mistakes and I take full responsibility. I was never on my knees but my pride took a hit and I'm now a bit poorer and a lot wiser,"" he says. ""Anybody who says the entrepreneurial journey is a straight curve upwards only is wrong. It's a roller coaster and if I couldn't deal with it myself then I wouldn't be much of a man."" Having made his name and much of his fortune from retail, the entrepreneur now doesn't own any store chains, having sold his stake in the House of Fraser department store to Newcastle United and Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley in a controversial move in April this year. Ashley still owns the 11% stake as the sale of the business to Chinese conglomerate Sanpower is yet to be finalised. The deal is thought to be awaiting Chinese regulatory approval. ""It was very straightforward. I checked if I could sell my shares, I could sell them and I got paid. The rest of the shareholders haven't got paid yet. There was a lot of talk about a legal wrangle but nothing ever came of it,"" said Hunter. His main investments now are in retail software company OrderDynamics as well as property investments including a portfolio floated on London's junior Aim market in June this year."	Business
307	308	EU contribution: Cameron will have to pay up, says Farage 	 has claimed that David Cameron will be forced to pay out an extra £1.7bn into the EU budget by the end of next month despite the government saying the extra demand was not acceptable. The Ukip leader’s comments, which he says is a reflection of Britain’s impotence in , will increase the pressure on the prime minister following Thursday night’s disclosure that Britain has been ordered to pay the money because its economy is performing better than other EU economies. A government source said the demand was “not acceptable”. It remained unclear on Friday morning whether the British government would challenge the EU demand in the courts,an option the Dutch government is reportedly exploring. But on an LBC radio phone-in on Friday morning, Farage said Cameron would have little option but to go along with the demand, which will have to be paid in December. “Of course he will pay up. These are the rules, the contributions to the was a very complex formula and part of it is a measurement of your GDP against everybody else’s. There’s nothing he can do,” he said. But prominent Tory critics of Europe continued to demand that Cameron makes a stand. Conservative backbencher John Redwood said the surcharge “offended all our principles of natural justice and fair taxation”. “It is a very large increase in tax on the British people charged retrospectively without their agreement,” he told Radio 4’s Today programme. He suggested the UK should simply refuse to pay the extra amount and that parliament should be asked to pass a law declaring the payment illegal. “The British people will not want to send another £1.7bn to the European Union by a very big majority and so the British government just says it won’t pay,” he said. Tory Eurosceptic Mark Pritchard said Cameron should consider bringing forward a referendum on whether the UK should leave the EU, which the prime minister has promised in 2017. British and European commission officials confirmed that the Treasury had been told last week that budget contribution calculations based on gross national income (GNI) adjustments carried out by Eurostat, the EU statistics agency, had exposed a huge discrepancy between what Britain had been asked to contribute and what it should be paying, because of the UK’s recovery. The bombshell, , was dropped into the middle of an EU summit in Brussels where Cameron and 27 other leaders were mired in tough negotiations over climate-change policy and attempts to agree big reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. A Downing Street source said: “It’s not acceptable to just change the fees for previous years and demand them back at a moment’s notice. The European commission was not expecting this money and does not need this money and we will work with other countries similarly affected to do all we can to challenge this.” The prime minister on Thursday evening conferred with Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, as the Netherlands has also been ordered to pay more than €600m extra into the budget, while other countries such as Germany and France are likely to have excess contributions returned. The commission told the various countries of the revamped figures on 17 October, EU officials said. They said the British had until 1 December to provide €2.1bn, roughly a fifth of the UK’s annual net contribution to the EU. The demand for the money is political dynamite for a prime minister wrestling with dilemmas over Britain’s future in Europe and broadly seen to be making increasingly Eurosceptic gestures to the restless backbenchers who want to deal with Nigel Farage’s Europe rejectionists. “The timing is far from ideal,” said Patrizio Fiorilli, spokesman for the EU budget commissioner. “But there are rules we have to follow.” “It’s crazy,” said Richard Corbett, a Labour MEP and former senior EU official. “This must be an automatic thing because politically the timing could not be worse.” The request for the money comes as Cameron and his party, under pressure from Ukip to bolster their anti-EU credentials, are embroiled in fights with Brussels and other EU capitals over freedom of movement and immigration within the EU, and over Cameron’s insistence on rewriting the terms of Britain’s EU membership before putting a new deal to an in-out referendum by 2017 if he wins a second term next year. Cameron has set great store on campaigning to reduce the overall EU budget, arguing that at a time of austerity and spending cuts all across Europe, the Brussels pot could not remain immune. Eurostat arrived at the €2.1bn figure on the basis of new methods of calculating member states’ GNI since 1995, taking account of previously unreported or under-reported black economy elements, such as drug-dealing and consumption or the sex industry. Eurostat concluded that the UK economy has been doing much better than previously assumed since 1995, relative to other European countries, and that British contributions needed to be upped. “It changes the way contributions to the budget are calculated,” said Fiorilli. “Some member states have booming economies. Everyone can see the UK is growing much faster than others.” Fiorilli said that the commission and Eurostat use 1995 as the benchmark year for calculating the impact of GNI figures. “Member states including Britain insisted on this. It is their decision,” he said. The demand comes as part of what is known in Brussels as an amending budget proposal, a routine event that occurs regularly and is dependent on the ebb and flow of payments into the EU machine. There are a further six amending budgets on the table in Brussels, some of which may entail returning funds to Britain, meaning the overall bill could yet be cut. While the €2.1bn bill is theoretically due by 1 December, the amending budget also has to be endorsed by the 28 governments of the EU and by the European parliament, meaning it could run into resistance if Britain is able to marshal enough allies and given that there are many European governments reluctant to hand an easy victory to those campaigning to take the UK out of the EU.

13635	13636	Hugo Lloris signs new five-year contract with Tottenham Hotspur 	France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris has signed a new five-year contract with Tottenham. The 27-year-old joined the North London club from Lyon two summers ago. A statement on Spurs’ website read: “We are delighted to announce that Hugo Lloris has committed his future to the club with the signing of a new five-year contract.” “I spoke with the chairman [Daniel Levy] and I know the club is as ambitious as ever,” said Lloris. “It’s very important to feel at home at a club and for my family to feel well. I enjoy a great relationship with the club and the fans. “The arrival of Mauricio Pochettino is important as well. I have a good feeling with him. He is also ambitious. “Everything is clear in my head and if I’ve signed a new contract it’s because I trust the club and I’m sure we will progress in a positive way. “Last season wasn’t the season we all hoped for but we were still able to finish sixth in the league. We know where we have to improve, the club also knows and there is a feeling and a confident connection between the club and the players.” Lloris has made 78 appearances for Tottenham since joining for €10m from Lyon, potentially rising to €15m (£8m rising to £12m).

1041	1042	US jobs dip quells fears of interest rate increase 	"Fears of an early rise in US interest rates were eased on Friday by weaker than expected jobs data, helping to pull global markets out of the tailspin they had endured in another volatile week of trading. But despite a recovery from their worst levels, shares still recorded a second day of declines. Both the UK and US markets have now fallen into negative territory for the year, after testing new highs not so long ago. Stronger than expected US growth figures on Wednesday, which showed second quarter GDP up 4% on an annualised basis, along with hawkish comments from US Federal Reserve board member Charles Plosser, had prompted fears that the central bank may increase the cost of borrowing sooner than expected. Plosser objected to the guidance in the Fed's latest statement saying interest rates would remain low ""for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends"". At the current rate, the monthly bond buying would be finished before the end of the year. But Friday's non-farm payroll numbers from the US showed 209,000 jobs were created in July, lower than the bumper 298,000 the previous month and fewer than forecasts of about 230,000. This was the sixth consecutive month of 200,000 plus employment growth, the first time this has happened since 1997. But the unemployment rate rose unexpectedly from 6.1% to 6.2%, while average earnings, a figure carefully watched by the Fed for its inflationary impact, were flat at 2% year on year compared to expectations of 2.3%. These slightly weaker than expected numbers suggested the Fed would be in no rush to raise rates from their current level of close to zero, and gave some support to battered share prices. James Knightley at ING Bank said: ""As the pool of available labour continues to shrink we will see wages respond positively and inflation pressures within the economy will build. Consequently, we look for the Federal Reserve's commentary to gradually shift in the months ahead and favour a rate hike early in the second quarter of 2015."" Sean Lynch at Wells Fargo bank told Reuters: ""The worry was that bad news would be bad for the market and good news would be bad for the market and we came right down the middle with this report. It still points to a job market and an economy that is improving, but we also have the absence of wage pressures building which [was] becoming another concern for investors."" Markets have suffered a turbulent few days, hit by a combination of rate rise concerns and growing geopolitical worries. The week saw Argentina defaulting for the second time in 12 years, while continuing tensions with Russia over the Ukraine led to the imposition of further sanctions which could hit businesses and put the brakes on global growth. According to Reuters, about 40 European blue-chip companies derive more than 5% of their revenues from the Russian market. The violence in Gaza also added to the sense of events escalating out of control. In Europe the troubled Portuguese bank Espirito Santo reported a quarterly loss of €3.6bn (£2.8bn), prompting talk of a possible emergency fundraising or state bailout and leading to its shares being suspended. The losses revived worries about possible contagion in the rest of the eurozone banking sector. There were also mixed July manufacturing figures on Friday, with US and Chinese manufacturing moving ahead but the UK and eurozone PMI surveys coming in below expectations. But following the US jobs figures, markets came off their worst levels. The 100 finished down 50.93 points at 6679.18 on Friday, having fallen as low as 6624. That was still a three day loss of nearly 130 points. In Europe, Germany's Dax dropped 2% while France's Cac closed down 1%. In Japan, the Nikkei fell 97 points or 0.6% on Friday, hitting a one week low although strong earnings from companies including Sony limited the damage. Meanwhile in the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down around 55 points by the time London closed. On Thursday the US index slumped more than 300 points – its worst daily performance since February – which wiped out all the gains made so far this year. It was only two weeks ago that the Dow hit a record high as the global economy seemed to be recovering and the withdrawal of central bank stimulus seemed to be proceeding according to plan. In the foreign exchange markets, the dollar slipped back against a basket of currencies as the prospect of US rate rise receded."	Business
1226	1227	Lights, camera, quick backflip: the eloquence of silent films 	"od knows how many films I've seen in my life (about one a day is my average), but I've seldom witnessed such a receptive audience as I did for the other week. Memories of all the silent films I watched during my childhood came swinging back to me; looking around, the rest of the cinema seemed to bask in a similarly rapt and innocent haze of pleasure. When it was over, they clapped as they would at the end of an exceptionally good play. Of all the many strengths of Michel Hazanavicius's film, the absence of words is the greatest. No words means no reliance on a form of communication that isn't, in fact, anything like as effective as we think. The language of gesture often says more – and it's always more passionate. It's obvious but easy to forget, even though we wonder every day why our exchanges by text and email seem so tinny and thin, why they fail to convey friendship, love or just plain amiability as warmly as we would like. Think of the reckless physicality with which the truly great movie stars put their stories across: Cary Grant, interrupting a polite compliment with a backflip in , just for emphasis. Or 's backbone, coiled like a spring as she swoops down to suck the breath from her lover's mouth as though it were honey. Or 's menacing waddle: is he an American hero or a crusty old curmudgeon? He's not letting on, and that's the point. Think of the mockingly girlish delicacy of Brando, or Monroe as she sashays down the side of the train in . Modern screen acting can seem very cerebral by comparison, and also rather corporate, as if having anything too interesting going on might upset the customers. While researching , about an eastern European immigrant who becomes a major player in Hollywood's golden age, I came across the autobiography of  , one of the founders of the British film industry. Hepworth recalled, at the age of 21, dashing up to the top-floor London workshop of the inventor Robert W Paul, the man who pioneered the projection of moving pictures on to screens in Britain. He wanted to sell the great man his newly invented electric lamp, and found himself clambering over a dozen or more Polish and Armenian Jews asleep on the stairs. These were travelling showmen, waiting for Paul's latest projectors to be delivered, so they could go back home and dazzle the peasants of the wide-flung shtetls, the Jewish communities of eastern Europe, with the wonders of cinema. I realised how deeply cinema had taken root in Yiddish popular culture before the first world war. And then how profoundly Yiddish culture had influenced American film, as the Hollywood movie moguls, almost all of them Jewish immigrants, transformed the plays, vaudeville acts, folk tales and sentimental musical comedies they remembered from the old country into an American art form. They then presented it, in true democratic fashion, coast to coast, in palatial theatres glowing with chandeliers and marble staircases, to rich and poor alike for a mere 25 cents admission. What were the stories these moguls told? Girl meets boy, they lose each other, they get back together. Corny? Sure, but that's how it is in peasant life and, come to think of it, that's how it is everywhere else. What else? A mixed-up young man clashes with his traditionally minded parents: a perennial theme in Jewish literature, as the cultural gap between city and shtetl grew wider. Any movie examples? Too many to count. And a popular tale from 19th-century Yiddish pulp fiction: a shtetl plagued by crooks and assassins is rescued by a man of exceptional courage who draws his gun and drives the baddies away. That's right: High Noon is a Jewish movie. The first talking film was , paradoxically not really a talkie at all, but a glorious silent-and-talkie piece of Yiddish schmaltz: after that, silent movies were dead. But my cinema-buff uncle Geoff, a stalwart of the Cape Town Film Society, went on showing them to my family throughout my childhood. Not all of them were as good as they were cracked up to be. The I found faintly malodorous: all those tacky moonbound trains and weird homunculi – and weren't the illusions merely stop-go camerawork? Even I could work that out, and I was only six. Chaplin was fine as long as he was funny; when he simpered, I blushed and looked away. Buster Keaton's cool and classical style was a lot more like it. , even in a tattered old print, was astonishing, and hypnotic in its beauty. I remember my mother's voice ringing through the darkness: ""Should Nicky really be watching this?"" I'm glad I did. Travelling Light, a new play by Nicholas Wright, opens on 18 January at the National , London SE1, nationaltheatre.org.uk. There will be a live cinema broadcast on 9 February"	Film
4041	4042	Government borrowing edges up in February 	"A rise in local authority borrowing pushed up the government deficit by £9.3bn last month, but left George Osborne's deficit reduction plan on track, according to official figures. The Office for National Statistics said that for the first 11 months of the 2013/14 financial year borrowing was down £4.4bn on the same months last year to £99.3bn. Coming days after the chancellor said the public finances would be in surplus by 2018-19, the latest monthly data showed the Treasury remains on course to hit its borrowing target of £107.8bn when the financial year ends in April. Osborne said better than expected growth in the next couple of years would close the public spending deficit – the difference between tax income and government spending – at a faster rate than predicted last year. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the figures represented mixed news for . He said the underlying improvement in February was undermined by comparison with February 2013, when the shortfall was limited by a £2.3bn transfer from the sale of 4G mobile phone licences. ""To meet his revised PSNBR [public sector net borrowing requirement] target of £107.8bn in 2013-14, the chancellor now needs the shortfall to come in at £8.5bn in March. This may prove difficult to achieve, given that there was a deficit of £11.4bn in March 2013,"" he said."" ""If the chancellor immediately just misses his newly set targets for 2013-14, it could increase scepticism that the chancellor will achieve his fiscal targets further out. The latest public finances highlight the fact that there is still an awfully long way to go in getting the public finances into decent shape."" Analysts dismissed the rise in council borrowing, saying it was a figure that would normally be spread over several months, but said concerns remained that cuts in public sector spending relied on . Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said it was worrying that tax receipts were still not responding to the economic recovery as positively as might have been hoped."

3614	3615	Melancholia – review 	"oody Allen once said: ""If I had to live my life again I'd do everything the same, except that I wouldn't see ."" By the same token, if I was told that the end of the world was nigh, I wouldn't waste my time seeing , Lars von Trier's celebration of the imminent extinction of planet Earth. I'd do something more pleasurable like taking an axe to a cigarette machine and smoking my first fag for 40 years, an activity I still associate with movie-going. However, I did nearly end my own life last Tuesday by the exertion entailed in walking from the eastern side of Covent Garden to the western end of Soho in 10 minutes, due to the distributors' bad planning of the press viewings. Breathing what seemed like my last, I slumped down a couple of minutes into the apocalyptic prologue of . Fortunately I'd read that this highly stylised pre-credit sequence introduced the principal characters and presented a collision between the wandering planet and our own, resulting in a one-nil victory for the visitors. A younger critic kindly stayed behind to describe in some detail what I might have missed, even telling me that there was a reference he knew I'd have noticed to . What then followed was two chapters named ""Justine"" and ""Claire"" after the sisters at its centre, who view each other with mutual loathing. Like most of von Trier's films since he burst on the international scene at the 1984 Cannes festival with , is in English rather than his native Danish, though it doesn't seem remotely like a British or American picture, despite the appearance of familiar English-speaking actors among the assorted Scandinavians. Moreover, like his oeuvre as a whole, it is, to quote the most famous, most melancholy of Danes, ""sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought"". Indeed like Hamlet, von Trier is a depressed, attention-seeking malcontent, forever insulting and playing malevolent games with those around him and inventing dramas such as Hamlet's ""The Mousetrap"", designed to disturb and expose the audience and leave it in a state of disarray. The film is set in an unnamed country at a remote chateau where Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and her husband arrive two hours late for their elegant wedding reception, hosted by sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her rich, tight-fisted husband John (Kiefer Sutherland). This blighted event, where everyone is at each other's throats, backbiting and bloodletting, is clearly reminiscent of Thomas Vinterberg's , the most celebrated of movies to come out of the much publicised Dogme movement that von Trier launched in the 1990s and imposed upon his Danish contemporaries. There are also echoes of Elsinore, of Marienbad, of a Sadean orgy (through the name Justine), and of the wedding reception in (Justine's father, played by , is called Dexter after CK Dexter Haven, the charming philanderer impersonated by Cary Grant in George Cukor's film). In an amusing and diverting way, the wilful, depressed Justine behaves appallingly, leaving and rejoining the party as she pleases. She urinates on a green on the surrounding golf course, has sex with a young stranger in a bunker, insults the best man (Stellan Skarsgård) who is both her new father-in-law and her employer at an advertising agency. But the carefully orchestrated festivities continue unabashed. Like the partygoers in Buñuel's , the wedding guests refuse to acknowledge the impending catastrophe. Meanwhile, the soaring romantic strains of Wagner's on the soundtrack direct us to Eliot's and to thoughts of luxuriant death. The film's second half is much more like a conventional disaster movie, both of the art-house (eg Tarkovsky's ) and Hollywood (eg Stanley Kramer's ) variety. Now alone and isolated on the grand country estate, Claire, John, their young son, Leo, and Justine confront, affect to confront or merely witness the approaching Melancholia which from once being a distant speck is now emerging over the horizon like some beautiful leviathan. Claire lays into suicide pills. The rational amateur astronomer John assures everyone that the danger will pass. Leo views the planet as another marvel of nature. Justine, however, emerging from her torpor to discover a new composure, seems to welcome the collision as bringing a fitting end to an evil, isolated, unnecessary world. At one eloquent point she rearranges a display of art books in the chateau's library to give prominence to reproductions of Edward Burne-Jones's and several Bruegel paintings, among them the chilly . There are a few striking images here, especially of the sisters out riding on fine horses, observed from a high angle through an early-morning mist. But the movie is heavy, though without weight or gravitas – a solipsistic, narcissistic, inhuman affair. And it is wholly devoid of humour, except perhaps for the meeting towards the end of Claire and Justine: the game is over and they're at a golf hole bearing a flag apocalyptically marked ""19"". Superficially, resembles Terrence Malick's e in its apparent engagement with big spiritual issues and matters eschatological, but it lacks Malick's emotional generosity."	Film
1660	1661	Magic in the Moonlight review – a Woody vehicle with serious engine trouble 	agic in the Moonlight isn’t Woody Allen’s worst film – that is still probably , from 2002 – but it’s still desperately disappointing after the glorious triumph that was , last year’s Oscar-winning smash about the cantankerous bankrupt socialite, played by Cate Blanchett. That was authentic Woody Allen, the real deal. There is, on the other hand, something unreal and absent about this lacklustre 1920s period picture, which clunks and clanks along on autopilot, with vague borrowings from PG Wodehouse, Agatha Christie and indeed Woody Allen’s own earlier work. Here, his male and female leads take romantic cover from a storm in an observatory: a throwback to the rainswept Woody and Diane Keaton rushing into the planetarium in Manhattan. Like the period automobile roadster that at one point in the film breaks down, this movie has some pretty serious engine trouble. Or maybe the problem is that it has no engine to speak of. There are strained performances, weird empty stretches where the gags are supposed to go and some frankly very uncertain line-readings. Set against this are moments of delicacy and absurd charm, all but drowned in the film’s heavy, flavourless stew. is cast, or typecast, or miscast, as the stuffy and conceited fellow destined to fall, Darcy-ishly, for the woman of whom he very much disapproves. He is Stanley, a British professional magician who performs in the hokey Oriental stage persona of Wei Ling Soo (a name that sounds as if it is some cheeky pun, but isn’t, unless Wailing Sue counts) with silly flowing robes, fake drooping moustache and bald cap. As well as being a magician, Stanley is an atheist and rationalist, a crusading debunker of all the fraudsters and phoney seance-hucksters preying on the rich and credulous in the jazz age. One summer, Stanley ventures to the south of France, dead set on taking down a supposed spiritualist called Sophie (Emma Stone) whose apparent powers are dazzling fashionable society on the Côte d’Azur; these wealthy chumps are getting out their cheque books to fund a supposed spiritual research foundation being set up by Sophie and her hard-faced mamma (Marcia Gay Harden). But Sophie’s extraordinary telepathic abilities and beauty leave Stanley stunned. Could magic – and the magic of love – be more real than he thought? Magic has always played an important role in Woody Allen’s work, but it has always tended to be real magic. Kugelmass really can transport himself into Madame Bovary in his short story The Kugelmass Episode; characters really can come down from the screen in The Purple Rose of Cairo; Leonard really does transform, chameleon-like, to become like the people he’s talking to. In Magic in the Moonlight, Stanley wonders, dumbstruck, about the seductive or dangerous possibilities of something he anachronistically calls “magical thinking”, but Allen has long ago proved himself a master of this kind of thinking with his inspired fantasies: the prerogative of both fiction and comedy. This is a different type of story about magic, and there is no reason why a rationalist movie about tricks shouldn’t be as light and soufflé-ish as everything else. But Firth’s character is just so boorish and monotonous, charmless and unrelaxed. He’s presumably supposed to be as airy and debonair as Cary Grant. Instead, he glowers like Gordon Brown. The problem is not deciding to laugh at him or with him, it’s finding any occasion for laughter at all. Well, the mechanics of the country house mystery in which Stanley finds himself provide some amusement, and there is some diversion to be had in the final revelation. Perhaps going to a new Woody Allen film is now the nearest thing audiences in the 21st century can have to seeing a run-of-the-mill prewar studio picture. We idolise and fetishise the great pictures from this period and forget about the fact that the dream factory churned out an awful lot of dross as well as the gold. The sheer volume of production is what increased the likelihood of excellence and this allows posterity to pick and choose the classics and forget the rest. It’s the same with . With remarkable and undimmed stamina, he just keeps making movies and I now think it’s beside the point for critics (like me) to complain about his workrate. This is his creative style. Even at its lowest ebb it still produces moments of interest. And it is capable of throwing out something like Blue Jasmine. It might still do in the future. So I am not complaining.	Film
3241	3242	TPP trade deadlock: Pacific countries near deal after biotech breakthrough 	A dozen Pacific countries have closed in on a sweeping free trade pact after a breakthrough over how long a monopoly pharmaceutical companies should be given on new biotech drugs. The issue has pitted the US, which argued for longer protections, and five other delegations which said such measures would strain national healthcare budgets and keep life-saving medicines from patients who cannot afford them. However, as befitting for negotiations that have been going on for five years, plans to announce the deal at the talks in Atlanta, Georgia on Sunday night were delayed. The last-minute hitch was caused by New Zealand’s insistence on greater access to overseas markets for its dairy exports, people involved in the talks said. “The thing that’s missing is (an agreement) on dairy market access,” one official said. US officials said a joint news conference had been postponed until early on Monday. The compromise on medicines thrashed in Atlanta would preserve Australia’s existing five-year protection period but would also offer flexibility on longer drug monopolies, potentially creating two tracks on future drug pricing within the trading bloc, a person close to the negotiations said. The terms of that compromise, hammered out after a third all-night round of negotiations between Australia and the US, still had to find support from other nations such as Chile and Peru, other people involved in the talks said. Mexican economy minister Ildefonso Guajardo said he could not reveal details of the compromise on biologics “until everyone has signed up and we are all on the same page”. But officials were increasingly confident of completing a deal that has been in negotiations for five years. Japan’s economy minister, Akira Amari, said he had called Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to notify him that a deal was within sight. The US offers 12 years of exclusivity for the clinical data used in developing drugs like cancer therapy Avastin, developed by Genentech, a division of Roche, in order to encourage innovation. Australia insisted on five years of protection to bring down drug prices more quickly. The trade pact – the Trans Pacific Partnership, or TPP – would lower tariffs and set common standards for 12 economies led by the US and Japan, which together account for 40% of global output. President Obama has pushed for a deal as a way to open markets to US exports, including financial services and pharmaceuticals. US officials have also promoted the deal as a counterweight to China and that rising power’s vision for Asia. The talks in Atlanta were extended by 24 hours to a fifth day on Sunday. A handful of protesters unfurled a “Stop TPP” banner at the Westin hotel, where the talks were taking place, on Sunday morning. They were escorted away by security and police. By Saturday, the US and Japan had reached agreement in principle on trade in autos and auto parts in talks that also included Canada and Mexico. That agreement is expected to give US automakers, led by General Motors and Ford, two decades or more of tariff protection against low-cost pickup truck imports from Thailand or elsewhere in Asia, people briefed on the talks have said. But the TPP deal taking shape would also give Japan’s auto industry, led by Toyota, a freer hand to source parts from Asia, including from plants outside the TPP-zone, like China, for vehicles sold in North America. A “rule of origin” would stipulate that only 45% of a vehicle would have to be sourced from within the TPP, down from the equivalent ratio of 62.5% under Nafta, officials have said. New Zealand wants to ensure its dairy industry, dominated by Fonterra, the world’s largest dairy exporter, comes out as a clear winner in a TPP deal by opening markets like Canada, Mexico, Japan and the United States. If US trade representative Michael Froman, chair of the Atlanta talks, manages to steer them to a conclusion on Sunday, that would mark the start of a political fight to get the deal approved in the US. The Obama administration relied on Republican votes to win fast-track trade negotiating authority from Congress in July, setting up a straight yes or no vote on any deal. Many Democrats and labour groups have raised questions about what the TPP would mean for jobs in manufacturing and environmental protections. Republicans, including Senator Orrin Hatch, the powerful chairman of the Senate finance committee, have urged the administration to hold the line on intellectual property protections, including for biologic drugs.

10177	10178	Women fare better in independent films than in Hollywood, study finds 	"Female directors remain woefully underrepresented in Hollywood but , according to a new study commissioned by the Sundance film festival and Women in Film. The survey found that there has been little change in the gender balance at Robert Redford's annual showcase of indie film-making in Park City, Utah over the past decade. (This year, however, male and female directors are equally represented at the festival, which kicked off on Thursday and runs until Sunday.) Overall, women represented fewer than one-third of the 11,000 directors, writers, producers, cinematographers and editors working on the 820 narrative and documentary films that have appeared at Sundance since 2002. ""There has been no sustained or meaningful change across the last 11 years in the percentage of [female] directors or producers at the ,"" said Stacy L Smith of the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, which carried out the survey. Sundance still does far better than the mainstream film-making sphere, however. Over the same period only 4.4% of the top-grossing Hollywood films were directed by women, and a remarkable 40% of these had come through programmes organised by the Sundance Institute. The study also found that female film-makers are more likely to employ other women on their productions. Separate studies have found that female directors are more likely to feature women or girls on screen, and the subject matter for their films is likely to be less violent and feature fewer guns and less blood and gore. The Sundance survey found that women were better represented in the factual film-making sphere: they made up almost half of documentary directors at Sundance since 2002. Organisers hope to use the results of the study to create mentoring and support programmes to increase the number of women working behind the camera in US film-making. Gender disparity in film-making has long been an issue but raised its head firmly above the parapet at last year's Cannes film festival after it emerged that . Organisers later apologised for the oversight following strident criticism from French feminists and critics."	Film
3532	3533	Andy Burnham says Labour will end NHS 'fast-track' privatisation 	"A government will repeal the coalition's controversial healthcare legislation in the first year of taking power, the party's health spokesman has declared. In a barnstorming speech, greeted by whoops and cheers, to party delegates at Labour's annual conference, said that the Tory-led coalition's health reforms had placed the NHS on a fast-track to fragmentation and privatisation and that the legislation had to go. Internally there has been a debate within the party about whether these populist measures could be easily implemented. Critics point out that Tory and Liberal Democrat peers will control the Lords and would almost certainly block attempts to roll back dramatically a key coalition policy – especially if Labour ended up seeking Nick Clegg's support to run the country. However, Burnham made clear that in ""the first Queen's speech of the next Labour government we will repeal the act"". Despite the bravura performance, Burnham did not receive effusive support from Ed Miliband during the question-and-answer session that followed shadow cabinet speeches. When a delegate asked the Labour leader not to move Burnham in the presumed forthcoming reshuffle, Miliband declined to back Burnham personally, saying that he was ""four-square behind Andy's ideas"". Burnham said the coalition's plans were built upon competition and privatisation, but Labour would offer a national health and care service, based on people before profits. He said this would mean ""whole-person care"", effectively bringing together the hospitals, mental health services and social care. Burnham announced that 25 councils, of differing political persuasions, had already agreed to road-test the idea. He also proposed that the NHS would have one named contact to co-ordinate the care of elderly patients, who were being driven towards hospital in ever greater numbers because of the failure to support them, he said. This would mean, he said, ""known care staff going with [patients] on to the ward"". There had been, in the last two years, a 66% increase in the number of people aged 90 or more entering A&E departments via blue-light ambulances, Burnham said. ""That's 100,000 very frail and frightened people in the backs of ambulances speeding through our cities and towns."" But the Tories suggested that Burnham's plans would be expensive. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, warned that repealing the bill would cost the taxpayer £5.5bn a year, with another £20bn required to create a national care service. However, Burnham claimed the NHS was being privatised with huge private health firms run by people who had donated £1.5m to the Tories, winning £1.5bn in NHS contracts. He also said that savings were being made by forcing the NHS to restrict patient treatment, a policy that would necessitate people having to pay hospitals for care. In October 2012 hospitals were given the right to generate 49% of their income from private patients. Labour said freedom of information requests to hospitals had revealed a significant increase in income generated from private work in the first year of the new arrangements. In 2012/13, hospitals generated £434m, an additional £47m on 2010/11. The NHS trusts projected that this would increase by a further £45m to £479m this year. The move to make money from patients comes as Burnham claimed that one in seven GP commissioners – those who buy care on behalf of patients – had introduced new treatment restrictions. Labour advised that this was growing evidence that some patients were being unfairly denied access to vital treatments. In his speech Burnham said: ""Thousands of older people denied cataract, hip and knee operations simply because of where they live – a postcode lottery running riot. And get ready for the next scandal. NHS hospitals, pushed by David Cameron to earn half their income from private patients, charging for beds left empty by these restrictions."" The hard-hitting words clearly pleased the Labour activists at conference. Such support will be crucial for Burnham, whose position in his present post has been called in question after about the party's need to be bolder."	Politics
8748	8749	RBS chairman makes plea as £2bn loss is announced 	" pleaded to be treated as a fully commercial business as it confirmed it is paying out £785m in bonuses despite recording another loss – of £2bn – last year. As the bank announced the fourth consecutive year of losses since its October 2008 bailout, chairman Sir Philip Hampton argued that it needed to be run on ""commercial grounds"" if taxpayers were to get their £45bn investment repaid. The state is currently sitting on a £20bn loss on its 82% stake, despite the shares rising 5% to 28.2p. Even as the bank insisted that bonuses were down and attempted to show restraint by imposing salary freezes on its 17,000 investment bankers and other high-paid staff, union officials were furious at 1% salary rises for branch staff who will not share in the £390m investment banking bonus pool. The retail arm recorded a jump in profits and David Fleming, Unite national officer, accused the bank of ""hypocrisy"". ""The bonus pot would give these low-paid employees approximately £6,000, which amounts to simply loose change for a City slicker,"" Fleming said. Rival bailed out bank Lloyds Group will also report losses on Friday and face a potential row over pay if it discloses a golden hello for new finance director George Culmer, who is to join in May. RBS insisted average pay for investment bankers had fallen 26% from £152,000 to £112,000 although calculations of average staff costs inside the investment bank showed they had remained steady at £144,000 despite a 54% fall in operating profit to £1.5bn. The compensation to income ratio – which shows how much revenue is used to pay staff – rose to 41% from 34% and the Association of British Insurers argued that the ""figures make it difficult to judge"" how far RBS was sharing the spoils between employees, shareholders and to strengthen its financial position. Chris Leslie, shadow Treasury minister, accused the chancellor of doing ""nothing to change the excessive bonus culture that continues to roll on and on"". The average investment banking bonus was £22,941, more than 50% lower than £50,114 a year ago, while the bonus pool for the 146,000 staff across the group was £795m. For accounting purposes the ""variable compensation"" was £985m. Chief executive Stephen Hester said his colleagues should not hand their bonuses back as he did – and warned the ""noise"" around RBS was damaging. ""You can't have your cake and eat it,"" said Hester. ""If you want an RBS that is mired in the past, a British Leyland, then we should be judged on a different basis,"" Hester said. He defended the investment bank, saying that without the £10bn of profits it had generated in the past three years another taxpayer bailout would have been needed. The £45bn bailout had been enough to keep the bank afloat but not to cover the £42bn of clean up charges incurred so far, paid for out of £33bn of operating profits, Hester said as he described an an ""Alice in Wonderland"" world in which bigger losses were proof of success as the bank wound down its balance sheet. Some £10bn of the clean-up bill comes from Ulster Bank's bad property loans. Ministers lined up in support of the pay deals, as did UK Financial Investments which controls the taxpayer stake. George Osborne said RBS was""cleaning up the mess after the biggest bank bailout in history"" and that ""bonuses at the investment bank are less than half what they were last year and less than a third of what they were in 2009"". Hampton admitted that ministers had been warned by ""many sources"" about the impact of anti-business rhetoric and not just on RBS. Hester revised down targets for return on equity from 15% to 12% but stressed that many other targets he set when he took the helm three years ago had been achieved, such as reducing the balance sheet by £700bn – which he described as twice the size of Greece's debt."

8126	8127	George Osborne accused of con trick over £1.7bn EU bill 	 did not raise a single complaint about Britain’s £1.7bn EU backdated bill and did not manage to get a single penny off the total, Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, has said. Balls said it was a con trick that took the British people for fools, after the chancellor claimed to have reduced the bill to £850m at an EU meeting on Friday by negotiating to make sure the UK’s rebate applied. Balls also joked that he could barely see John Bercow, the Speaker, for all Osborne’s “fog and bluster”, because it was always obvious that the UK would get its usual discount on the bill. A from the European budget commissioner on 27 October proves the rebate was always going to apply and was never in doubt, Balls said. Addressing the chancellor, Balls said: “Isn’t the truth the chancellor has failed to reduce our contribution by a single penny? “All he is doing is simply counting the rebate that was due anyway, a rebate that was never in doubt, trying to fool people into thinking the bill has been halved. His so-called victory is nothing more than a con trick.” He said minutes from the EU meeting showed Osborne did not object to the bill and questioned Treasury claims that the chancellor had received legal advice casting doubt on whether the rebate would be applied. But Osborne pointed out that Balls did not mention the application of the discount when the latter, in an , set out the sum that the UK would have to pay, along with interest payments based on the £1.7bn total. Posing in the Commons with a copy of the newspaper, the chancellor said it was “not clear” before the meeting that the rebate would apply, reducing the total to £850m. “If it was the case that was always going to apply, why was it not mentioned before?” he said. Osborne said the UK’s bill had been halved from £1.7bn, had been delayed until 2015-16 and would include no interest. The chancellor was backed by supportive Tory MPs. But the pro-Europe former cabinet minister Ken Clarke cast doubt on the idea that the chancellor had won a great battle. He said it was a “surprisingly good” deal but probably the result of a friendly chat rather than “gunfight at the OK Corral”.	Politics
3744	3745	Labour extends lead over Tories to 11 points, according to new poll 	 has stretched its lead over the Tories to 11 points, according to a new Opinium/Observer poll. The poll puts Labour on 38%, the Conservatives on 27%, and the on 9%. The Tories have dropped four points in two weeks, and David Cameron's personal popularity is now almost on a par with that of . That will be a particular tonic for the Labour leader, who has consistently suffered in comparisons with Cameron. According to the poll, 33% of respondents approve of Cameron, and 51% disapprove. That compares with 25% who approve of Miliband, and 44% who disapprove. Opinium Research has also carried out polling on the public's attitude to free schools. Last week the row over the al-Madinah free school in Derby continued after Ofsted found the school dysfunctional and teachers claimed they were forced to wear a hijab. Despite the headlines, 44% of likely voters in England think free schools are generally a good thing, while 22% think they're a bad thing. However, 60% are concerned about free schools hiring teachers who may not have a PGCE or equivalent, while 30% are not. Views on the future of free schools are fairly mixed. Nearly a quarter (23%) think they should continue as they are, while 27% think they should continue only if there is a shortage of places in local schools and all teachers have a PGCE or equivalent. One in five believe that free schools should no longer be funded and existing ones should be taken under local authority control.

12162	12163	Steven Gerrard vows to return to Liverpool in the future 	 has pledged to return to Liverpool because he feels he has a contribution to make to the club in the future. The 34-year-old is enjoying a post-season break before he begins a new challenge in Major League Soccer with Los Angeles Galaxy this summer. But after 710 appearances in a 17-year professional career at Anfield, Gerrard has his sights set on coming back. “I’ve been a supporter all my life and that will continue,” he wrote in an open letter to fans in the Echo. “I hope to get the opportunity to come back and serve the club again one day. I feel that I can make a contribution in some role in the future.” Gerrard has been captain for more than a decade and led from the front in most of the club’s recent successes, most famously . However, this season he has not featured as regularly as he would have liked and that persuaded him a move to the United States would help prolong his playing career despite a contract offer coming in late from the Reds. “I want to keep playing every week in the final few years of my career and I’m looking forward to embarking on a new challenge with Los Angeles Galaxy in the MLS,” he added. “It’s been an absolute privilege to represent this football club for so long. It’s been very humbling and it’s something I’ll cherish for the rest of my life. “People have often asked me about the pressure on my shoulders to deliver for Liverpool but I’ve never seen that as a burden. It’s been a massive honour to be captain of this club for so long. I’ve always given my best and tried to lead by example.” He added: “But today is all about looking back and saying thank you to the fans for the magnificent support you have given me over the past two decades. You have helped me to fulfil my dreams over and over again and given me memories I wouldn’t swap for anything.”	Football

7668	7669	Harman seeks to end Labour row with ‘reasoned amendment’ to welfare bill 	Labour’s interim leader, , has tried to defuse a rebellion over welfare by tabling an amendment setting out why the party disagrees with the government’s proposed bill, but suggesting that Labour MPs abstain rather than vote against. Labour has been plagued by infighting since Harman that the party would not block the bill but would instead try to amend parts of it at committee stage. The decision to table a “reasoned amendment” came after Helen Goodman, the MP for Bishop Auckland, tabled a backbench amendment opposing the bill. It also followed further talks with the new intake of MPs on Wednesday night and again with at least 10 shadow cabinet ministers on Thursday. The amendment, setting out why the bill should be rejected, was put forward by Harman in an effort to prevent the party from splitting on an issue that has been made more difficult as leadership candidates try to signal their positions while retaining collective shadow cabinet responsibility. The frontrunner for the leadership, , this week called for the party to oppose the welfare bill if a reasoned amendment was defeated. Burnham met Harman on Thursday afternoon and is understood to be pleased that such a motion is being proposed, but his aides refused to disclose whether he would then oppose the bill rather than abstain, if the amendment was defeated. Aides to , the shadow home secretary and a leadership rival to Burnham, also said she clearly opposed the bill, but insisted they would not brief on how the party should vote if the amendment is defeated. Another shadow cabinet meeting may be needed to thrash out a final position after party whips have taken further soundings. An already-demoralised party can hardly afford a big split on welfare with different leadership candidates voting different ways. Any divisions will be exploited by George Osborne, who is intent on portraying as the party of welfare as opposed to a Conservative party committed to work. Harman at the weekend said Labour needed to wake up and understand the reasons for its defeat, including public rejection of the party’s stance on the economy and welfare. She said abstention on the welfare bill would be a signal that the party was prepared to change. Her stance led to a rebellion in the parliamentary party, and she clearly hopes she has crafted a compromise that sets out the party’s reasoned differences with the government without lapsing into a blanket opposition that gives the impression Labour is not willing to reflect and change. The reasoned amendment calls for controls on and reforms to the overall costs of social security and supports the proposed reporting obligations on full employment, apprenticeships and troubled families in the bill as well as a benefits cap and loans for mortgage interest support. But it says the house should not give the bill a second reading since it would “prevent the government from continuing to pursue an ambition to reduce child poverty in both absolute and relative terms”. Harman will also propose that the party go out and listen to the public on welfare reform, including on the proposal that tax credits should only be provided to the first two children. She retains her position that the party needs to recognise that many people in work, and not on tax credits, limit their family size for financial reasons and will resent it if they believe the same financial constraints are not being placed on those on benefits. Helen Goodman, the leader of the backbench rebels, said she welcomed Harman’s decision to table an amendment but added: “I cannot see why if you table a reasoned amendment rejecting a bill you would then go onto abstain in a further vote on the bill. It would be best to oppose all the way through because of the damage the bill does to people in poverty.” Harman’s stance has created tensions in the context of the Labour leadership election with some Burnham supporters believing she was trying to portray him as an opponent of reform. But she is understood to feel strongly that she consulted the relevant shadow cabinet colleagues and insists she has no other motive than reflecting a recognition of the public mood. Meanwhile Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign, still surging in terms of constituency nominations, hit trouble when one of his prominent young supporters claimed if Corbyn won he would have to act swiftly to purge staff at the party headquarters and bring the parliamentary party into line. Max Shanly, a Corbyn supporter on the national committee of Young Labour and active in Unite, saying: “I think Jeremy will face problems not just inside the parliamentary Labour party, which I think is likely to split if he wins with the Blairites buggering off to form a new SDP, but also from the Labour party bureaucracy. New Labourism is still a hegemonic force at Brewers Green (Labour Party HQ) and despite having resigned as leader eight years ago, Blair is still the piper who plays the tune many party staff listen to. “The Labour left will have to act swiftly and I am afraid brutally in many cases. The PLP will have to be brought into line, some members of party staff will need to be pointed towards the exit, and the entire party structures would, in my opinion, need to undergo a comprehensive and thorough review. On the latter point, essentially we need the sweeping away of the current party form.” He added: “It would not be wrong to describe Jeremy as the Bennite continuity candidate, but with the advantage that the ideas Benn espoused and others worked for have finally seen their time come.”	Politics
568	569	Nestlé agrees to pay all employees living wage 	"Food giant Nestlé has become the first leading manufacturer to commit to paying the living wage. The firm already pays at least the living wage to its 8,000 staff but the move will benefit contract employees and agency workers. About 800 contractors working with Nestlé will implement it by December 2017. The announcement was described by campaigners as a significant milestone in the drive to persuade employers to pay the living wage, which is currently set at £8.80 an hour in London and £7.65 elsewhere, compared to the national minimum wage of £6.31. Nestlé UK & Ireland's chief executive, Fiona Kendrick, said: ""We are proud to be the first mainstream manufacturer in the UK to become a living wage employer and see this as an opportunity to be a positive influence in our sector. ""As a major UK employer, we know that this is the right thing to do. Not only does it benefit our employees but also the communities they live and work in."" Living Wage Foundation director Rhys Moore said: ""The accreditation of Nestlé as a living wage employer marks a significant milestone in the campaign to tackle in-work poverty. We hope that the leadership they have shown will encourage others in this industry to follow suit and improve conditions for those at the lowest end of the pay scale and sub-contracted staff. ""We are aware that Nestlé is going above and beyond the basic requirements of becoming an accredited employer, and is extending their commitment to graduate, internship and school leaver programmes."" Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, said: ""With in-work poverty on the rise, many employers are simply ignoring their responsibility to pay staff a decent wage. They should take note from Nestlé's positive stance which shows that paying a living wage is not just good for communities but makes good business sense too."" Tim Roache, of the GMB union, said: ""Nestlé have always recognised their greatest asset is their workforce and are demonstrating this with action, not just words. This shows once and for all that if one leading manufacturer can pay a living wage to all employees including young workers and those contracted out, then many more are able to do so."" The business secretary, Vince Cable, said: ""I welcome Nestlé's decision and encourage all businesses to pay their staff above the minimum wage when it is affordable and not at the expense of jobs."" The shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, said: ""It is fantastic news that Nestlé is announcing its accreditation as a living wage employer, having worked in collaboration with Unite, GMB and the Living Wage Foundation to achieve this. ""We want to see as many businesses as possible take the decision to become living wage employers, so I hope other firms will follow the strong example which Nestlé is setting."""	Business

On Monday, the fast-food giant revealed that for a 12th straight month, same-restaurant sales around the world were down. The 0.3% drop, however, exceeded expectation. Analysts expected a decline of 0.9%. The figures were mainly achieved thanks to a 2.3% increase in sales in Europe.

6440	6441	David Cameron's Scotland visit presents problem for the no campaign 	" arrives in Scotland on Thursday in the peculiar position of being the old Etonian Tory leader who volunteered to help set up Scotland's independence referendum and the man hated by yes campaigners for being an old Etonian Tory. The leader of a party with just one MP in , Cameron is the bogeyman of the independence movement, instigator as prime minister of a severe austerity programme, greater NHS privatisation in England and of welfare reforms which led to the widely-hated bedroom tax and tax cuts for the wealthiest. He is, say Scottish National party officials, one of the best recruitment sergeants for a yes vote. His government in London is the focus of Yes Scotland's final phase of the referendum: that Scotland ""must"" vote yes, to save itself from the Tories. Those Westminster-driven reforms are influencing tens of thousands of Labour voters to consider backing independence, as a protest vote against a Tory-led government, helping Scotland's once disparate socialist and green left to unite in a new, highly motivated coalition, the Radical Independence Campaign. So Alex Salmond, the first minister, knew he was touching a raw wound when he goaded Labour's Alistair Darling, leader of the pro-UK Better Together coalition which has the Tories as a significant junior partner, in Monday's BBC independence debate with the charge ""You're in bed with the Tories."" It is an uncomfortable alliance for the former Labour chancellor; the SNP has put him the awkward position of having to defend UK government health spending and policies.So addressing the annual dinner for the Confederation of British Industry's Scotland branch in Glasgow on Thursday night serves to amplify that problem for the no campaign. But behind this is a more complex picture and one which presents Salmond and Yes Scotland with its own challenges: by focusing so much fire on Cameron and the Tories in a bid to attract centre-left votes, they risk creating divisions amongst Scottish voters. By implication, Scots who admire or back the prime minister and his party are enemies too. The Tories do have a profound image problem in Scotland, and their support remains fixed at less than 20%. Yet in the last European election, the Tory vote rose slightly to 17%, even as Ukip gained historic high with 10% of the vote, winning their first breakthrough European seat in Scotland. And the polls suggest too that Cameron is twice as popular as his party: Ipsos Mori found in August that while 15% of Scots would vote in Tory for the Scottish parliament – where the Tories have 15 seats, Cameron in person had a 30% satisfaction rating amongst voters. Cameron's advisers insist that Salmond and the yes camp's focus on the prime minister and the Tories has little impact, portraying it as ""dog whistle politics aimed at their core vote"". They argue that Cameron has played a largely very positive role in the referendum, after all, he agreed to make the referendum constitutional and fair, by granting the Scottish parliament the legal authority to stage it. ""He was the capitalist who made it happen,"" said one Downing Street official, who argues Cameron has helped frame a positive tone to the debate. ""He was the one to say you're no less in love with your country by wanting it to be part of something bigger"" the adviser said. ""His poll ratings aren't the horror story that they like to portray."" Yet that Ipsos Mori poll also exposed how greatly he is disliked: his dissatisfaction rating was at 66%. He had the highest recognition rating of all the main party leaders, a point higher than Salmond. And so the predicament for the no campaign is – with the yes campaign putting such heavy emphasis on Tory policies in the final weeks of the campaign, whether there is a clear risk his presence will drive more wavering centre left voters to say yes in the referendum, and put even greater pressure on Labour to stop that happening. After all, Tory voters are the most committed no voters. He has no need to convert them."	Politics

Brady, the Tories’ small business ambassador – who was appointed to the House of Lords last year – makes the appeal on a members’ section of the party’s website under the headline “Please sign our business letter”. The proposed letter says: “This Conservative-led government has been genuinely committed to making sure Britain is open for business … We would like to see David Cameron and George Osborne given the chance to finish what they have started. A change now would be far too risky and would undo all the good work of the last five years.” Brady’s letter shows Tories believed they achieved something of a coup when the last week endorsing the party. The signatories to the letter included 32 business leaders, who have donated more than £9m to the Conservatives. signed by more than 100 people “from all walks of life” endorsing Ed Miliband’s approach to the economy. The proposed letter by Brady, who made her name as the managing director of Birmingham City football club, comes after supporters of the health secretary emailed sympathetic doctors to ask them whether they would be prepared to back the plea on behalf of Hunt. The email says: “There is a letter being put together saying that the shouldn’t be used as a political football during the election campaign. If you are willing in principle to support this, please reply to Jeremy Hunt’s adviser.” The Tory fightback was revealed by health writer Roy Lilley. He : “Tories canvassing for a ‘support the NHS’ letter from doctors – the games continue!” A Labour source said: “The Tory campaign is in crisis. Yet again we are seeing unsubstantiated attacks on Labour which the Conservative party is coordinating backfiring, left, right and centre. “Only Labour will cut and freeze business rates, set up a small business administration and a proper British investment bank to back small firms and tackle the national scandal of late payment. Where the Tories have failed to act, the next Labour government will.”	Politics
8027	8028	Eurozone crisis: policymakers fear worst after losing control 	We have been here before. As battle-hardened veterans of the panic of 2008 were quick to point out, early November 2011 has started to look frighteningly like mid-September 2008. It is not just that a policy error – George Papandreou's decision to pursue a referendum – has triggered financial market mayhem, although it has. Nor is it just that there has been a deluge of bad news. It is the inescapable sense that policymakers have lost control of the situation and now fear for the worst. That's how it was three years ago when the US Treasury allowed Lehman Brothers to go bust. And that's how it has been this week following the announcement by Papandreou that he wanted to hold a referendum – hastily abandoned on Thursday – on the bailout package agreed for . At the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund six weeks ago, Britain's chancellor, George Osborne, set a six-week deadline for the eurozone to resolve its sovereign debt crisis. Those six weeks expire with the current two-day gathering of the G20 group of developed and developing nations in Cannes, and it is an understatement to say that the deadline has not been met. Greece is in turmoil, with Papandreou on his way out and elections likely. Silvio Berlusconi's days are also numbered, with his departure likely to take place against the worrying backdrop of an intensifying financial crisis in Italy. Bond yields on Italian debt climbed sharply on Thursday to their highest levels since the creation of the single currency. Just as the contagion from Lehmans quickly spread to other banks seen as weak – HBOS and RBS, in Britain's case – so the infection has spread from Greece to other vulnerable eurozone members. Nor does the parallel end there. Within a week of Lehmans going down, even banks that had appeared healthy were at risk. The current increase in French bond yields is a deeply troubling development. How will this end? Well, nobody in Cannes needed to be reminded that the six months after the Lehman bankruptcy saw the biggest collapse in global economic activity since the 1930s, with a seizing-up of banking, industrial production and trade. In Britain's case, national output fell by 7% and in the subsequent three years only half the lost ground has been regained. The fear is this: back in 2008, policymakers were well armed, united and fresh. Today they are none of those things. Interest rates have been cut to the bone, the money taps turned full on, the public finances trashed. Ammunition of the traditional kind is running out, leaving central bankers and finance ministries dependent on untried ways of boosting activity. That will be made more difficult because of lack of agreement in any relevant forum – the G8, the G20, the or the Euro Group – about what should be done. There has been a spectacular lack of leadership. Finally, it is clear that politcians, especially those in , are exhausted. Take a look at Nicolas Sarkozy. He looks spent. Policymakers have to galvanise themselves for one last effort because, if they don't, the risk is that the recession about to engulf them will be as bad as, if not worse than, that seen in 2008-09. Problem number one is that monetary union is a flawed concept and always has been. A one-size-fits-all interest rate didn't work and intensified the boom-bust cycles of the weaker eurozone states. Problem number two is that the debt crisis is far from over, and its continuation has compounded the pressure on the peripheral eurozone countries. The banking system remains dysfunctional and credit is both scarce and expensive. Britain and the United States have at least been able to relieve some of the pressure on their economies through a depreciating currency. Greece, Italy and Spain have not enjoyed that luxury. Problem number three is that there has been a series of blunders in the handling of Greece, which throughout has been a question of too much and too little: too much austerity and too little recognition that the problems of one small country could be as systemically important as one relatively small American investment bank. Sarkozy and Angela Merkel must now be ruing all those missed opportunities when they could have accepted the need for a clean Greek default rather than settling for muddling through. Almost certainly, it is now too late to avoid the eurozone sliding back into recession this winter, dragging the UK with it. Even now, though, it would be possible to prevent a full-blown slump. First, the European Central Bank needs to start buying Italian bonds aggressively and regularly. The odd €5bn of purchases will not be sufficient: the ECB needs to be thinking in terms of €500bn or €1tn. Given the magnitude of the crisis, Germany will, inevitably, object strongly, but Merkel has a stark choice. Germany can either sanction massive intervention by the ECB or it can accept that the single currency will shrink to perhaps a handful of countries, in which case the euro will go through the roof and kill Germany's export-led economy. Second, the G20 needs successfully to complete the negotiations in Cannes to increase the firepower of the International Monetary Fund. The IMF is going to need cash, and plenty of it, if it is to help bail out Europe and be a more effective lender of last resort. Third, there has to be a recognition that the fetish for austerity in some countries is proving self-defeating. Those who warned that the global economy was not fit to withstand savage budget cuts so soon after coming off the life support machine have been proved right. The current low bond yields in Britain, Germany and the US are a sign not of strength but of distress, but they do afford the opportunity to borrow for long-term, productive capital programmes at very attractive rates. That opportunity should be seized, because policymakers need to re-engage with electorates unhappy about the lack of jobs, the squeeze on living standards, the widening gulf between the haves and have-nots, and the overriding feeling that big finance has got away with it. The mood is ugly, and unless policy-makers act with a sure-footedness and sensitivity not seen up to now, it is about to get uglier.	Business

14298	14299	Alleged Silk Road founder ordered to New York to face charges 	"A federal judge on Wednesday ordered a California man charged with operating a notorious online drug marketplace known as to be sent to New York to face charges. The order by US magistrate judge Joseph Spero came during a brief court hearing in for Ross Ulbricht. Federal authorities in New York have charged Ulbricht with three felonies related to the operation of the website. Ulbricht's attorney, public defender Brandon LeBlanc, has denied the charges. Silk Road gained widespread notoriety two years ago as a black market bazaar where visitors could buy and sell drugs using bitcoins, a form of online cash. A so-called hidden site, Silk Road used an online tool known as Tor to mask the location of its servers. Ulbricht agreed to remain in custody. Authorities have said Ulbricht operated the website under various aliases, including ""Dread Pirate Roberts"". His attorney denied he used any aliases. While many other sites sell drugs more or less openly, Silk Road's technical sophistication, its user-friendly system and its promise of near-total anonymity quickly made it among the best known. The FBI shut down the site when they arrested Ulbricht on October 1 at a small branch library in San Francisco as he chatted online with a ""co-operating witness,"" according to authorities and court papers. He is also charged in Baltimore federal court with soliciting the murder of a former worker who was arrested on drug charges. The indictment alleges Ulbricht feared the former worker would turn on him. The FBI said Ulbricht unwittingly hired an undercover agent for the murder, which the FBI staged but never took place. Prosecutors in have charged Ulbricht – a Texan who was living in San Francisco and holds degrees from the University of Texas and Penn State – with trying unsuccessfully to solicit the murder of a Canadian man who allegedly hacked into Silk Road, obtained dealers names and began blackmailing Ulbricht. FBI agents appear to have penetrated the behind-the-scenes operations of Silk Road and obtained a list of the site's users and sellers, court papers show. In the following days, authorities in Britain, Sweden and the United States arrested eight people who are charged with using the site to sell drugs. In Washington state, a man and a woman were arrested on charges of selling cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine through the now-shuttered website. In the UK, the country's newly established National Crime Agency . ""These latest arrests are just the start; there are many more to come,"" said Keith Bristow, head of the agency. In court papers, the FBI said it had managed to copy the – something one expert said would likely provide international authorities with detailed information about the site's dealers. Silk Road's eBay-style customer review system means that months' worth of sales history are now in law enforcement hands, according to a computer expert who studies bitcoins. ""Any large sellers on Silk Road should be very nervous,"" said Nicholas Weaver, a researcher with the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley and the University of California, San Diego. The traceable nature of bitcoin transfers means the FBI ""can now easily follow the money,"" Weaver said in an email."	Technology
1851	1852	Surprise inflation fall may put interest rate rise on hold 	The prospects of an interest rate rise in the next few months have dimmed after inflation fell to a five-year low last month. Official figures showed inflation dropped to 1.2% in September from 1.5% in August as food and fuel prices fell. The easing pace of price rises will take some pressure off households that have been struggling with below-inflation pay rises for years and will be welcomed by homeowners who had been bracing themselves for higher mortgage costs in the new year. The inflation figure also means the basic state pension will rise by 2.5%, or £2.85 a week, in April, as the government’s “triple lock” guarantees a rise of whichever is the greater out of average earnings, September’s inflation rate or 2.5%. Financial markets were caught off guard by the fall as City economists had expected a more modest slowdown in consumer price inflation (CPI) to 1.4%. The pound weakened against the euro and the dollar, and yields fell on UK government bonds as traders pushed back bets on when the central bank will start to raise rates from their current record low. The markets are now pricing in the first rise in borrowing costs for mid-2015. Until now the market consensus had been the early months of next year, though some economists had warned growth was softening and price pressures were benign. “We have long been expecting the Bank of England to first raise interest rates from 0.5% to 0.75% in February – but it is looking ever more likely that the Bank will delay acting until nearer mid-year,” said Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight. “Much will clearly depend on just how well UK growth holds up over the coming weeks and months, as well as how much wages move up in the 2015 pay settlements,” he said. The . Food and fuel prices also fell on the year after a supermarket price war and a sharp fall in crude oil prices. Excluding volatile items such as food and fuel, there was still a let-up in price pressures and core inflation stood at 1.5%, down from 1.9% in August. The retail price index measure of inflation, which includes housing costs and is used to set many pay deals, fell to 2.3% from 2.4% in August. The Bank has a government-set consumer prices index (CPI) target of 2.0%. If inflation misses that by more than one percentage point on either side, the governor, Mark Carney, must write an open letter to the chancellor, George Osborne, explaining the reasons and what the Bank proposes to do about it. Samuel Tombs of the Capital thinktank thinks there is a good chance Carney will have to put pen to paper given inflation looks likely to fall further over coming months owing to falling oil prices and pledges from utility companies to freeze prices this winter. Tombs also pointed to separate official figures that showed prices paid and charged by manufacturers continued to fall in September. “The absence of any major underlying inflationary pressure should still ensure that interest rates rise at a very gradual pace by past standards,” he said. The Treasury welcomed the fall in inflation as “further evidence that the government’s long-term economic plan is working”, and also highlighted the 2.5% rise in the state pension. “That means around an extra £150 more in the pockets next year of those that have worked hard all their lives,” said a Treasury spokesman. But some economists noted that the proposed rise in pension payments will leave a disparity between benefits paid to young and old. Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, said: “September’s inflation rate usually has important ramifications for public finances, as it is used to uprate benefit payments. However, with government policy limiting growth in most working age benefits to 1% next year, the net gain to the exchequer from a lower inflation reading will be limited. “Pensioners are set to enjoy a relative windfall. With inflation and earnings growth so low, the ‘triple lock’ means that pensions are set to rise much faster than pay or benefits received by younger people.” Labour pointed out that inflation is still higher than average pay growth, meaning wages continue to fall in real terms. Catherine McKinnell, the shadow Treasury minister, said real wages had fallen by £1,600 a year since 2010. “The squeeze on working people continues despite this fall in the rate of inflation. Total pay is rising at just 0.6%, which is half the rate of CPI inflation announced today,” she said.	Business
7986	7987	Ed Miliband warned to stop talking about north-south divide 	" and other Labour frontbenchers have been told to stop making the ""classic mistake"" of talking about a north-south divide if they want to avoid alienating voters in southern England who abandoned the party at the last election. frontbenchers have been told to bear in mind the commuter on the ""6.54 from Basingstoke"" if they are to win back trust among voters in southern England outside London. The appeal has been made by , the former cabinet minister and MP for Southampton Itchen, who has carried out a review to examine how Labour can improve its performance in the south. Denham is one of just 10 Labour MPs elected in 2010 in southern seats outside London, the same number as in 1992, when Labour also lost. Tony Blair won about 40 seats in the south in 1997. Denham used a to define the north-south divide. This creates a line from just south of Grimsby to the northern side of the Severn Estuary before it joins Wales. Denham : ""It used to be quite common to hear people talk about the north-south divide. If you think about that, the message is that everybody in the southern part is doing OK. If you use that language, it sounds as though you represent the northern bit. A classic mistake for the party for a long time was using that sort of language – and then wondering why people in the south didn't think we were talking about them."" Denham's report is designed to help Miliband, who was London born and raised and was elected as MP for Doncaster North in 2005, as he seeks to develop his message of creating a so-called one-nation Labour party. After the 2010 election the former local government secretary , which was first published after Labour's 1992 defeat. Denham told the Times the Labour party should try to use examples of pressures of life in the south. ""If someone in the Labour party talks about rail fares, a southern voter may not automatically think they were talking about them, on the 6.54 from Basingstoke. You have to make the point that you are talking about the 6.54 from Basingstoke. ""There are towns around London where the average wage may be above the national average, but because the costs of housing and transport are so high, the living standards are below the national average. Part of what we are doing is making sure we are clearly rooting what we say with the lives of people in the south."" The 6.54 is a genuine commuter train from Basingstoke, the constituency of the culture secretary, Maria Miller, which is close to Denham's seat. It arrives at London Waterloo at 7.59am. Denham says Labour should reach out to former supporters by saying it understands why they supported the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives in 2010. He told the Times: ""It will be a very sympathetic approach that says: 'Look, we can understand why in 2010 you put your trust in the Tories and the Liberal Democrats, but actually you have been failed by them.' We will leave people [in the south] in no doubt that it is them we are appealing to, and that we want them to trust us as a party of government."""	Politics

3216	3217	UK business minister to tackle steel dumping in China trip 	The government looks set to clash with Chinese ministers next week after promising to raise the sensitive issue of steel “dumping” following a new threat to 3,000 jobs in the north east of England. George Osborne leads a delegation to Beijing which includes the business minister, Anna Soubry, who said on Friday that she would raise the issues that are threatening the survival of the Redcar steel works. “We help with energy costs and recently voted to protect our steel industry from Chinese dumping. Next week I am in China and I will talk to Chinese officials,” said Soubry. She was speaking after SSI, the owner of the plant on Teesside said it was going to halt production and mothball some operations amid mounting financial losses. The company blamed a deteriorating steel market for the suspension of output at the 160-year-old site. It said it hoped to resume production eventually. The Thai-owned SSI is struggling to pay outstanding debts, leading to speculation about how long it could keep going while employing 2,000 staff and 1,000 contractors. Any closure would be a heavy blow because levels of unemployment are among the highest in Britain. “We are taking this pause in production in order to re-evaluate and assess the situation following the outcome of ongoing discussions with our various stakeholders, including government and suppliers,” said Cornelius Louwrens, SSI’s UK business director. “It is with great regret that we have had to make this announcement and we are deeply aware of the concern it will give to our employees and their families.” SSI bought Redcar from Tata Steel, which had mothballed the plant. Last month, Tata announced plans to . In July, the India-based group said it might need to , amid high UK energy prices and mounting competition, particularly from low cost products made in China. SSI said the price for “slab” steel – usually further processed to use in pipes and tubes – had plummeted from $500 a tonne to below $300 over the past year. “The problems within the global steel industry have been well publicised in recent weeks and our decision follows a major deterioration in steel prices affecting our business during the course of this year,” it said. Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of Community, the steelworkers’ union, said: “Our first thoughts are with the workers who will be affected by today’s announcement. We will be seeking urgent talks with SSI management to find out the full extent of the impact this will have on both SSI employees and contractors.” And the industry lobby, UK Steel, said this business sector was facing a major threat and urgent action was needed by ministers. “It (the SSI decision) comes just 24 hours after the government agreed to hold a crisis summit about the UK steel industry and this cannot happen soon enough,” said Gareth Stace, Director UK Steel. “I trust ministers will put in place the machinery to get on with this as a priority and that they will bring tangible offers of support. The time for warm words has passed. ... If they don’t act decisively, then the damage to one of the most important industries underpinning our entire manufacturing sector will be irreversible.”	Business

Due to its decentralised nature – the currency does not rely on any centralised agency to process payments, instead relying on work done by users’ computers – it is popular for a number of fringe-legal and illegal uses. One of those uses was Silk Road, where was required for all transactions.

At current exchange rates, that represents slightly more than 5% of all bitcoins in circulation. Even if the FBI is not able to transfer the money, now that Ulbricht is in captivity and most of his possessions have been seized, the funds are likely to stay where they are. A few high-security ways of storing bitcoins, such as a ""brainwallet"", a way of converting a bitcoin address into an easy-to-remember phrase, could still bypass their authority, but there is no indication at present that Ulbricht has used them. This article has been amended to clarify why Ulbricht's funds have apparently remained untouched."	Technology

The £38m fine is the second punishment Barclays has received for breaches of client asset rules. It is bigger than , when City regulators began focusing on client asset rules in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The unwinding of Lehman has proved more complex because its own assets were mixed up with those clients, making it more difficult to pay them back. Almost a dozen fines have been handed out for this breach of the rules, which in Barclays’ case is thought to cover the period between 2007 and 2012. While this time frame predates the appointment of Antony Jenkins as chief executive, the latest punishment comes as he attempts to defend the bank against fraud charges in the US and after . There had been reports that the latest fine for Barclays could be as high as £60m, which would have been on top of the for failing to keep clients’ money separate from its own.

6807	6808	Fred Goodwin could lose knighthood, says David Cameron 	"The knighthood awarded to Sir Fred Goodwin, the former chief executive of the , will be referred to the honours forfeiture committee, David Cameron has said. The prime minister said the committee, which has powers to strip recipients of their honours, would take into account a by the Financial Services Authority. Goodwin was at the helm of RBS when it was in effect nationalised in 2008 after making a £24.1bn loss. Responding to questions about Goodwin's knighthood, Cameron said: ""I think it is right that there is a proper process that is followed for something of this order. There is a forfeiture committee in terms of honours that exists and it will now examine this issue. I think it is right that it does so. ""Obviously it will want to take account of the Financial Services Authority report which I think is material and important because of what it says about the failures of RBS and what went wrong and who is responsible and the rest of it."" He said the committee rather than the prime minister should make the decision. In a keynote speech, in which he called for a new form of popular capitalism, Cameron said he expected the cash element of bonuses at the state-owned banks RBS and Lloyds to be restricted to £2,000 for a second year. He said the remuneration committee of RBS had yet to meet to decide whether to give the RBS boss, Sir Stephen Hester, a large bonus, adding that non-executive directors approved by the government would argue his bonus should be smaller than last year. ""There has been no meeting of the remuneration committee of RBS so no decision has been made,"" he replied to questions about bonuses at the bank. Referring to Hester, he said: ""If there is a bonus, it will be a lot less than last year."" ""As a major shareholder in the City we will be repeating what we did last year and restricting bonuses in all state owned banks to £2,000."" He said bank managers, tellers and junior staff were doing their best so there should be a small cash bonus. In his speech, Cameron put emphasis on wider shareholding, stronger markets and less regulation and said strong markets promoted morality. ""We should use this crisis of capitalism to improve markets, not undermine them,"" he said. In a speech in London billed as his attempt to position the Conservatives as the party ideologically and historically equipped to create a responsible capitalism, the prime minister admitted the link between risk, reward and effort had been broken. He insisted: ""We won't build a better economy by turning our back on the free market. We'll do it by making sure that the market is fair as well as free."" Markets can be made to work ""by empowering shareholders and using the power of transparency"", he said. He also insisted the answer did not lie in more regulation but less, so long as it was better. He argued: ""While of course there is a role for government, for regulation and intervention, the real solution is more enterprise, competition and innovation. ""Where they work properly, open markets and free enterprise can actually promote morality. ""The fundamental basis of the market is the idea of something for something – an idea we need to encourage, not condemn,"" he said. The speech contained little by way of new policy, except to promise to combine 17 different pieces of co-operative legislation into a single bill. He argued the Conservatives were well placed to reform markets because ""we get the free market. We know its failings as well as its strengths. No true Conservative has a naive belief that all politics has to do is step back and let capitalism rip."" Admitting markets can fail, he said: ""Uncontrolled globalisation can slide into monopolisation, sweeping aside the small, the personal and the local."" Drawing on the control of the East India Company, the repeal of the corn laws, the Factory Act and William Pitt's reforms of government, he argued that Tory governments had repeatedly controlled capitalism. He pointed out he had, at the start of his leadership, argued that the previous government's turbo-capitalism turned a blind eye to corporate excess. Labour, by contrast, had made a Faustian pact with the City encouraging a debt-crazed economy to fund its welfare bill, he said. He claimed Labour feared standing up to the City and mistook the interests of big business for those of the economy. ""The City, which should have been a powerhouse of competition and creativity, became instead a byword for a sort of financial wizardry that left the taxpayer with all the risk, and a fortunate few with all of the rewards. ""So instead of popular capitalism we ended up with unpopular capitalism."" He praised genuine reward, saying: ""When people take risks, with their own ideas, energy and money, when they succeed in a competitive market where anyone can come and knock them off their perch at any time, we should celebrate entrepreneurs who get rich in that way."" But he warned: ""Large rewards for failure when companies are suffering means even less is left over for customers and shareholders."" Without giving details, he said the business secretary, Vince Cable, would set out proposals next week, and he also promised to implement the Vickers report on banking designed to separate retail and investment banking. He also promised to ""bust open the cosy collusion between big business and big government that locks small businesses out of public sector contracts – a market worth £150bn a year"". He argued that capitalism would never be free unless there were genuine opportunities for everyone to participate and benefit. He said the answer to better equality of opportunity lay in better education ""with academies, free schools, rigour in exams and a complete intolerance of failure"". ""In an age when we're having to cut public spending, we are investing more in early years childcare,"" he said. He said the task was to create an insurgent economy, arguing Britain was fizzing with business potential and what he admired more than anything was ""the bravery of those who turn their back on the security of a regular wage to follow their dreams and start a company"". He ended by arguing for the need to build a fairer economy, saying Britain needed more shareholders, more home-owners, more co-operatives and more entrepreneurs. There are too many barriers in the way of forming co-operatives, he said: ""Right now there are too many barriers in the way, 17 separate and outdated pieces of legislation add cost and complexity."""

10375	10376	Adnan Januzaj wins place in preliminary Belgium World Cup squad 	" midfielder Adnan Januzaj will be included in Belgium's preliminary World Cup squad, head coach Marc Wilmots has confirmed. Last week Wilmots revealed Januzaj had pledged his international allegiance to despite interest from England, Albania, Kosovo, Turkey and Serbia. Januzaj will have a chance to impress Wilmots at a pre-World Cup training camp next month, although the Belgium coach has warned the teenager he is not guaranteed to make his final 23. ""I have seen him play several times and now I want to see him with the squad,"" Wilmots told Le Soir. ""I will include him in the list of 30 pre-selected players for the and he will be one of the 26 or 27 players who take part in training in Genk and then in Sweden. ""I prefer to keep the numbers down but Januzaj will be there."" Januzaj joined United from Anderlecht in 2011 and was promoted to the first-team squad last summer following a series of impressive performances in the youth sides. The 19-year-old made his debut in United's Community Shield win over Wigan last August and he has since gone on to make 32 appearances and score four goals. Wilmots has not promised the flexible teenager he will be going to the World Cup, although the Belgium coach conceded his chances had improved following the news that Aston Villa forward Christian Benteke will miss the tournament in Brazil because of a torn Achilles tendon. ""Things were clear between us: he has received no assurance from me of a place in the World Cup squad,"" Wilmots added. ""I only said he was selectable. Adnan and his entourage were very receptive and understood the message perfectly. The truth will come out on the pitch and he will have to win his place like everyone else. ""What is for sure is that the boy is an interesting player in the absence of Christian Benteke. Not many people know but in the Manchester United reserve team, he has often played as a number nine. His versatility is an asset."" The Football Association was keen to get Januzaj to commit to England, even though the player would have had to wait until 2018 to pull on the Three Lions due to residency rules. But Januzaj, who has Kosovar-Albanian parents, instead chose to represent the country of his birth following a meeting with Wilmots. ""With Adnan and his father, we spoke for a bit more than three hours,"" the Belgium coach revealed. ""I explained to them both that I know well the sensitivity for a family in Belgium who retain links to their country of origin. I told them whatever Adnan decided would be respected. ""Adnan was born in Brussels, went to school here and his education as a young footballer came at Brussels and Anderlecht before he headed overseas."""	Football
11541	11542	Chelsea 2-2 Swansea City 	José Mourinho was right. This is the real deal, what people want, what they can’t wait to devour. This was that edge-of-the-seat, don’t-dare-blink, full-pelt competitive heat of football that counts. Every point counts. And here, in quite intense fashion, dropped two on game one of their title defence. An engrossing match twisted and turned, with both Chelsea and Swansea taking turns to swing their swords, charge on the offensive and retreat to catch their breath. In a topsy-turvy encounter the home team led twice and the visitors bounced back to equalise. It was all played out with a generous twist of drama. The most extraordinary moment denied Chelsea a winning start when Thibaut Courtois was sent off in a reckless attempt to stop Bafétimbi Gomis from advancing past him. Swansea’s powerhouse attacker maintained his composure to tuck away the penalty and earn Garry Monk’s team a proud result. Mourinho had suggested his team would have to offer more to defend the title than , and here was proof of the complexity of the challenge. There was a lot to digest. While Mourinho was at great pains to avoid getting tangled up in another conspiracy fandango so early in the season, in the wider analysis Chelsea sent out mixed messages here. At times they were dazzling, displaying the synchronicity and zest that a confident team of winners can ooze. At others they were frayed, as Swansea strutted their own stuff and exhibited a mix of power and panache to unsettle the best of defences. They also bristled with the desire to win even with 10 men. There was so much to take in packed into the 90 minutes. The opening notes seemed to blend seamlessly from last season’s songbook. Within seconds Eden Hazard – the current – was gliding at speed through the Swansea half. Diego Costa, fit enough to reclaim the position he occupies in inimitable fashion, hassled a defender and nudged at the opposition goalkeeper just because he can’t resist it. Oscar crafted the lead midway through the first half. When César Azpilicueta won a free-kick just a fraction outside the corner of the penalty area, the Brazilian delivered with whip and fizz. Both Gary Cahill and Branislav Ivanovic tried to get a nick on the ball, but neither were needed as the ball curled past Lukasz Fabianski. Swansea, determined to avoid being overwhelmed as they were against Chelsea last season, recovered with character and wit. The sparkling Jefferson Montero stood up a wonderful cross for Gomis, who powered in a header that Courtois reacted to superbly to beat out. André Ayew picked up the rebound and steered in the equaliser, showing neat footwork to carve out space for the shot at the second attempt. The new boy from Marseille was overjoyed. It was riveting stuff, and back came Chelsea to retrieve the lead within a minute as Willian’s effort spun off Federico Fernández’s foot and looped over the helpless Fabianski. The game was finely poised. Yet despite moments of excellence from Chelsea, Swansea sensed there were goals to be plundered themselves. And when another one came, it was fuelled by high drama. Chelsea were stunned when Jonjo Shelvey’s delightful chipped pass sent Gomis marauding goalwards. He was met by Courtois, whose attempted tackle caught the Frenchman at thigh level on the edge of the penalty area. The result was a penalty for Swansea and a red card for Courtois. The delay as Asmir Begovic prepared himself to come on and face the spot kick had no ill effect on Gomis. He was coolness personified as he slotted in for 2-2. Monk felt it was entirely merited. “The message to the team is we can take anyone on,” he said. “I wanted the team to showcase what we can do on the front foot and to come to a place like this, after the goals we conceded last season, we wanted to put that right. It’s just one game, one point, but to come and do it here where we suffered last season should give us confidence.” Mourinho chose not to talk about the red card other than to suggest it “changed everything”. Despite that, both teams had a whiff of winning the game. Montero was on a mission to unpick Chelsea at will. Defenders of Ivanovic’s ilk don’t often experience the kind of chasing he endured trying to keep pace with the Ecuadorian’s wizardry. Even with reduced numbers, Chelsea were able to press and probe, but with wariness of what might befall them at the other end. Could they somehow seize victory from the jaws of difficulty and disappointment? Hazard, who after a bright start had been peripheral by his standards, roused himself to dart into the box and drive an angled shot which hit Fabianski. Hazard began to bewitch Swansea, dominating the momentum almost single-handedly. On came Radamel Falcao to see if he could make the difference. When the stakes overheated, Ashley Williams took a yellow card for hoiking down the increasingly determined Hazard mid-dribble in stoppage time. At the end of it all, both teams looked wrung out and exhausted. The fun and games have only just begun.	Football
7982	7983	Lessons from Greece and other unsuccessful bailouts 	s the Greek crisis evolves, it is important to understand that a successful structural adjustment programme requires strong country ownership. Even if negotiators overcome the most recent sticking points, it will be difficult to trust in their implementation if the Greek people remain unconvinced. That has certainly been the experience so far. And without structural reform, there is little chance that the Greek economy will see sustained stability and growth – not least because official lenders are unwilling to continue extending an unreformed Greece than it is asked to pay. (This has been the case through most of the crisis, even if one would never know it from the world press coverage.) Greece’s membership in the gives its creditors significant leverage, but evidently not enough to change the fundamental calculus. Greece remains very much a sovereign country, not a sub-sovereign state. The troika of creditors – the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank, and the European commission – simply do not enjoy the kind of leverage over Greece that, say, the Municipal Assistance Corporation wielded over New York City when it teetered on the edge of bankruptcy in the mid-1970s. The best structural adjustment programmes are those in which the debtor country’s government proposes the policy changes, and the IMF helps design a bespoke programme and provides the political cover for its implementation. Imposing them from the outside is simply not an effective option. So, for reforms to take hold, the Greek government and its electorate must believe in them. That a country must take ownership of its reform programme is not a new lesson. The IMF’s with Ukraine began long before the latest round of negotiations. Back in 2013, IMF staff wrote a on the organisation’s experience in the country. Their conclusion, in essence, was that the government’s failure to embrace the reform process fully all but guaranteed its programme would not work. If a government is incapable of or uninterested in making the needed adjustments, the report argued, the best option is to drip money out as reforms are implemented, as is now being done in . Unfortunately, that approach has not proved adequate to overcome the challenges there. Structural reform conditions often tilt the balance between competing domestic factions, for better or for worse. If there is no will inside the country to maintain the reforms, they will quickly be undermined. Leftwing ideologues have long viewed structural-reform programmes with deep suspicion, accusing international lenders such as the IMF and the World Bank of being captured by neoliberal market fundamentalists. This critique has some truth in it, but it is overblown. To be sure, structural reforms often favour policies such as labour-market flexibility. But one should not make the mistake of viewing these interventions in black-and-white terms. Breaking down dual labour markets that are excluding young workers (as they do in much of southern , including Italy and, to some extent, France) is very different from making it easier to fire all workers. Making pension systems sustainable does not amount to making them stingier. Making tax systems simpler and fairer is not the same as raising all taxes. Recently, opponents of structural reform have put forward more exotic objections – most notably the problem caused by deflation when policy interest rates are at zero. If structural reforms simply lower all wages and prices, it may indeed be difficult in the short-term to counter the drop in aggregate demand. But a similar critique could be made of any other change in policy: if it is poorly designed, it will be counter-productive. The truth is that the way forward in Europe requires achieving greater productivity. The lessons from Greece and other unsuccessful bailout programmes are sobering. If a debt bailout programme requires a wholesale change in a country’s economic, social, and political model, the best course of action might be to write off the private losses, rather than pour in public money to cover them. In cases like Greece, the creditors’ passion for structural reforms might be better directed at home – particularly toward . . In an ideal world, offering financial aid in exchange for reforms might help those in the country who want to shape it into a modern European state. But given the difficulty Greece has had so far in making the necessary changes to reach that goal, it might be time to reconsider this approach to the crisis completely. In place of a programme providing the country with further loans, it might make more sense to provide outright humanitarian aid – regardless of whether Greece remains fully within the eurozone.

5459	5460	Is Elderwood the digital arms dealer that fuelled attacks on Google? 	"Researchers have of a group believed to be selling highly valuable attack code to prolific cyber espionage hackers, including the team that was linked to a . Whilst Symantec researchers admitted they could not be certain a computer exploit owned by the digital arms dealer, known as Elderwood, was used against , it has been operating since at least 2009, when the tech titan was hit. The Elderwood supplier has frequently been linked to the 2009 attacks, which Google blamed on China. One customer, known as Hidden Lynx, was also associated with the campaign against Google, which targeted a range of US organisations. Hidden Lynx was identified as the group that breached security company Bit9 in 2012 too. Elderwood exploits have been used against a large number of industries, including defence, technology and human rights organisations, throughout 2014 and before. It was previously believed only one hacker group used the attack code, known as ""zero-day"" exploits because they use unpatched vulnerabilities in computer software. But it has become apparent more than one threat actor is involved, pointing to Elderwood as a zero-day supplier, possibly a professional outfit selling to government entities. The dealer has been linked with various zero-day vulnerabilities this year, including ones found in Internet Explorer and Adobe software. Various links between the different teams and the Elderwood supplier have been uncovered. They include code being hosted on the same web server and common hacking tools across groups. This has led Symantec to two likely scenarios. Either Elderwood is a parent organisation for many different but linked groups who are being handed the attack tools directly, or it is single arms dealer supplying any buyers who have their own separate agendas. There have been no signs of any technical links between Elderwood customers, such as shared command and control tools for their maware, said Gavin O'Gorman, senior security response analyst at Symantec. That there is one central supplier providing such attack code is rare to see, O’Gorman added. “We haven't seen that kind of common exploit development before,” he said, comparing Elderwood to a professional software company. Despite leaving its footprint on the internet, O’Gorman is doubtful the Elderwood group will ever be stopped. “It's not one central thing you can shut down. Although there are kind of little bits and pieces [that we can tie together], they change things up enough so that it makes it difficult for us to detect them. “For these kinds of attacks, I'd be surprised if you could arrest them... they've been around since at least 2009 and they haven't slipped up and revealed identities. There's not a lot you can do.”"	Technology
13993	13994	Fifa corruption arrests: Uefa calls for postponement of presidential election 	 has called for Fifa’s presidential election on Friday to be postponed as the shockwaves from the biggest scandal to hit the world governing body reverberated through the sport. Fifa was plunged into the most serious scandal in its history on Wednesday . Seven officials, including the Fifa vice-president Jeffrey Webb from the Cayman Islands, were arrested by Swiss authorities on behalf of the US Department of Justice, which has indicted 18 people alleging bribery totalling more than $150m (£98m). In a separate development, the Swiss attorney general also opened criminal proceedings over the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, seized documents and electronic data from Fifa’s headquarters and will question 10 current executive committee members who voted on that tournament. The twin proceedings have cast Fifa into a state of crisis and Uefa wants Friday’s presidential election between incumbent and Prince Ali Bin al-Hussein of Jordan to be postponed. Uefa general secretary Gianni Infantino, speaking in Warsaw before the Europa League final, said in a statement: “Uefa believes that the Fifa congress should be postponed and that the election for the president should take place within six months.” The full Uefa statement following an executive committee meeting said: “Today’s events are a disaster for Fifa and tarnish the image of football as a whole. Uefa is deeply shocked and saddened by them. These events show, once again, that corruption is deeply rooted in Fifa’s culture. There is a need for the whole of Fifa to be ‘rebooted’ and for a real reform to be carried out. “The upcoming Fifa congress risks to turn into a farce and therefore the European associations will have to consider carefully if they should even attend this congress and caution a system, which, if it is not stopped, will ultimately kill football. The Uefa member associations are meeting tomorrow ahead of the Fifa congress. At that point, the European associations will decide on what further steps need to be taken to protect the game of football. “In the meantime, the members of the Uefa executive committee are convinced that there is a strong need for a change to the leadership of this Fifa and strongly believe that the Fifa congress should be postponed, with new Fifa presidential elections to be organised within the next six months.”	Football
13083	13084	James Gandolfini, remembered by Mike Figgis 	" was larger than life. I directed an episode of and got to know him a little. This was season five and it was clear that the cast and crew had been in the trenches with the show for a very long time. The characters were so strong that I had some difficulty separating the real names from the fictional. My first meeting with everyone was a table reading of the episode I was to direct, three days before we were on set. it was the lunch break and everyone was frazzled. I was the only outsider in the room. James sat next to me but we had no conversation. I contributed nothing to the read and then everyone left to continue shooting. Monday morning arrived and at 7am I found myself on the set. Lighting was quick, it was an ongoing set and suddenly the 1st assistant director got everyone's attention and it was over to me. I was extremely nervous. I sounded pretentiously English among all those New York accents, I knew a little but no-one else. I suggested a way of shooting the scene which involved James turning his back on his gang, giving a nice camera angle and also indicating that Tony Soprano was playing a double game. I had done my homework and thought it all out, or so I thought. James looked at me for the first time, a look of puzzlement combined with a ""Who is this guy"" expression. ""Why the fuck would Tony Soprano turn his back on his guys?"" It went quiet. Now I had everyone's attention. I wanted to die. The part of the brain that remains coherent whispered to me, don't argue with him. ""OK,"" I said. ""How would you do it?"" This sounded so weak, first bit of directing an admission of incompetence. I sat down and gave the floor to James and his merry men. Now, there were circumstances. Mr Gandolfini liked to party at weekends and he was nursing the mother of all hangovers. But from my perspective all I could see was my own failure with two weeks of humiliation stretching ahead of me. Perhaps I would be fired. On the floor, Tony Soprano and the boys tried the scene out ... and it was not working. James got more and more bad tempered and it seemed to me that everyone got more and more tense. Things ground to a halt. I had no idea what to do nor did I have any authority on the set, a new experience for me. ""OK, OK,"" said Gandolfini, ""let me try something."" And so the scene began again and this time he did exactly what I had suggested in the first place, but it was like he'd thought of it. I wanted to sob, I wanted my mother. And then James turned, looked at me in a very mean kind of way and then a huge grin spread across his face, he stuck out his hand and said, ""Fucking honour to have you on the show, big fan, welcome."" I'd been royally wound up by the big Gand'. Later, Buscemi told me he sometimes did that, liked to test directors out a bit. Thank God I didn't cry. After that we got on fine and at the end of the shoot he threatened to take me drinking but I chickened-out of that offer. I feel honoured that I got to direct him in such an iconic series. He was a really good actor and a very warm-hearted human being and way too young to exit."	Film
11524	11525	Aston Villa 2-0 West Bromwich Albion 	It has been quite a week for Aston Villa and Tim Sherwood, and one that promises to transform the complexion of their season. Fabian Delph’s first goal for 12 months, followed by a second from Scott Sinclair five minutes from time, condemned to a second defeat in the space of five days at the hands of their neighbours and secured Sherwood’s side a place in the FA Cup semi-final. That should have been the story of this fiercely contested local derby but the ugly scenes in the closing stages meant that the result was totally overshadowed by the sort of behaviour that everyone hoped belonged to another era. Albion supporters in the upper tier of the North Stand tore out seats and used them as a missiles while at the other end of the ground Villa supporters invaded the pitch during and after the game. Tony Pulis, the West Brom manager, described the pitch invasions as disgraceful and there was no sense that he was exaggerating the seriousness of the situation when he claimed that the players’ safety was put in danger. It was a free-for-all at the final whistle as hundreds of Villa fans spilled on to the pitch, leaving even their own captain feeling distressed. “Very, very scary,” said Delph, who claimed that he lost his armband, a boot and was bitten. Questions will be asked of the stewarding, the police and both clubs over the coming days, as well as the decision to stage a local derby with so much at stake at 5.30pm on a Saturday night. It is safe to say that the Football Association’s “crowd control adviser” – there was one present – is in for a busy weekend writing up everything he witnessed. A range of sanctions are available to the FA, although the likelihood is that both clubs will be fined, with Villa’s punishment expected to be more severe. There was also some controversy of a different kind in the shape of the two red cards that Anthony Taylor, the referee, showed in the second half. West Brom’s Claudio Yacob seemed particularly unlucky to be given a second yellow card for a foul on Leandro Bacuna in the 80th minute. Jack Grealish, a second-half substitute for Villa, was later given a second yellow card for diving. Pulis was bemused by both decisions. “It’s really, really disappointing. We’ve come here twice in five days.[Alan] Hutton should have been sent off in the week, doesn’t get sent off and he gets the cross in that [Ben] Foster spills and costs us a goal late on. “Today, really and truthfully, Yacob’s not a sending off. It’s two poor decisions. I don’t know what Grealish got sent off for. I was absolutely amazed when he showed a red card.” By the time Villa were reduced to 10 men the game was effectively over, with Grealish having set up their second goal moments earlier. Sinclair, arguably Villa’s most dangerous player in a much-improved second-half performance, took it superbly, checking inside Chris Brunt before curling a low right-foot shot from just inside the penalty area into the far corner. There was no way back for West Brom, who were left to rue their profligacy in the first half, in particular the two chances that fell to Brown Ideye, the first after only eight minutes when the Nigerian looked certain to score when he ran on to Craig Gardner’s fine first-time cross. Instead Ideye contrived to lift a left-foot shot over the crossbar. He should also have done better with an opportunity later in the half when he shouldered, rather than headed, Craig Dawson’s inviting centre from the right, leaving Shay Given with an easy save. Missing the injured Christian Benteke, Villa looked flat in the first half and created precious little but they carved a breakthrough shortly after the restart. Charles N’Zogbia, who seems to be flickering into life under Sherwood, picked up possession wide on the right and cut infield. With Dawson sucked to the ball and playing more like a centre-half than a right-back, space opened up for Delph in the inside-left channel. N’Zogbia released the ball at just the right time and the England international did the rest, drilling a low left-footed shot beyond Boaz Myhill, who was picked ahead of Ben Foster, and inside the near post. Albion could – and should – have been level six minutes later but Joleon Lescott was guilty of a poor miss that had Pulis spinning on his heel in frustration. Gardner’s corner kick from the left was inadvertently flicked on at the near post by Tom Cleverley and Lescott, arriving at the back post, looked destined to score. Inexplicably he headed wide. Chances came and went at both ends as the game became stretched. Given had to be quick off his line to smother at Saido Berahino’s feet while Sinclair went close for Villa twice in the space of two minutes. The winger was not so generous, however, when presented with a third opportunity. It is just a shame that few people were talking about his final goal afterwards.	Football
11091	11092	Greek government takes desperate measures in battle to stay afloat 	The Greek government is resorting to increasingly desperate measures to keep afloat amid dire warnings the debt-stricken country could go bust within weeks. In a balancing act not seen by any European administration in recent times, the cash-strapped coalition has sequestered the reserves of public bodies, seized EU subsidies destined for farmers and postponed all payments for state supplies in the scramble to continue servicing its debt and paying salaries and pensions. Pension funds have been raided to raise money for Treasury bill auctions. “It is clear we are reaching the end and very soon won’t be able to pay,” former finance minister, Stefanos Manos, told the Guardian. “They are scraping the bottom of the barrel for everything they can find.” To cover the credit crunch, corporations in which the state has a majority stake, including the Athens Metro, have been tapped. The scheme of repo transactions – where government bonds are used for short-term borrowing requirements – is believed to have raised upwards of €600m (£442m) in recent weeks. Earlier this month the leftist-led coalition suspended some €300m of EU subsidies for farmers to help pay €1.7bn in public sector wages and pensions due next week. Greek subsidiaries of multinationals have also been approached for loans. The last-resort measures came as Deutsche Bank warned that Athens was at risk of being pushed into default on 9 April when it must meet a €450m debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund. The precarious state of Athens’ finances has been exacerbated by a precipitous decline in tax revenues – more than €1bn below target since January – said the bank’s economists. Deposit flight has also ratcheted up the pressure. More than €20bn has fled the country since the beginning of the year as savers rush to withdraw funds, worried about Greece’s ability to remain in the euro. “The risk of capital controls continues to rise,” noted the Deutsche report. In what was interpreted as a sign of growing concern over the outflows, the – among the bodies that have bailed out the Greek economy to the tune of €240bn – agreed on Wednesday to raise emergency liquidity for local banks by €1bn to €71bn. As the government marked national Independence Day with celebrations that included a fly-past of fighter jets and tanks rumbling through the capital, hopes of easing the credit squeeze with a €1.2bn injection of cash from the EU were quashed. Athens’ argument that it had mistakenly returned the money to the EU’s rescue fund, from the country’s bank recapitalization fund, was rejected by Brussels. This week the ECB raised the pressure further by formally restricting Greek banks from buying government debt. The move makes agreement over reforms with international creditors ever more urgent and prime minister has been given until Monday to draft measures that will convince peers he is determined to overhaul the economy. Lenders have promised to unlock a €7.2bn aid disbursement if progress is made. In the two months since the anti-austerity government assumed power, relations with creditors – and especially Europe’s paymaster Germany – have worsened dramatically amid the administration’s brinkmanship over reforms. Talks between Tsipras and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, in Berlin on Monday helped soothe tensions, but the young Greek premier was told in no uncertain terms that his country’s fate now lies in his administration’s ability to devise persuasive structural changes. “They urgently need to present a coherent list of reforms and I am worried because they constantly seem to be backtracking,” said Manos, finance minister under a former conservative government. “Such a plan will definitely entail taking decisions that will displease some voters. The government has ruled out taking recessionary measures but such reforms will naturally be grossly recessionary. Tsipras simply has to explain the reality to Greeks.” Athens has come under fire for its treatment of technical teams dispatched by the EU and IMF to examine the government’s books. With money running out fast officials said it was expedient that now, more than ever, auditors were given free rein. The teams have been forced to meet in hotels out of view of Greeks who have accused monitors in the past of behaving like colonial overlords. “They haven’t been allowed into the general accountancy office and ministries,” said Jens Bastian, an Athens-based economics analyst and former member of the European commission task force for . “There’s been a certain lack of professionalism in the way they have been treated, one could call it rather confrontational,” he added.

2919	2920	Cabinet Office minister and deputy chief whip resign from government 	"David Cameron's long-serving deputy whip, John Randall, and his youngest minister, , have resigned ahead of a reshuffle in which the prime minister is expected to promote a number of women. Downing Street's surprise announcements sparked speculation that Cameron will shake up junior roles within his team as early as Monday. They follow the resignation of transport minister Simon Burns, who wants to stand as deputy Commons speaker, with rising stars such as Sajid Javid, Esther McVey and Nicky Morgan tipped for bigger jobs. Randall, who has served in the Tory whips' office for 13 years, said he informed the prime minister last year that he wanted to return to the backbenches. He is best known for his role in the resignation of his boss, Andrew Mitchell, the former chief whip, over the ""plebgate"" scandal just over a year ago. Randall passed on information about Mitchell's alleged behaviour after one of his constituents claimed to have witnessed the former minister swearing at police officers and calling them ""plebs"". Mitchell always strongly denied the accusations and the constituent turned out to be a serving officer, who was later arrested as part of a wider investigation into an alleged conspiracy. In his resignation letter, Randall assured the prime minister that he would continue to do ""whatever I can for you personally as well as for the party, the government and of course the country"". ""I know that it is customary to write at these times that it has been a great privilege and honour to serve as a member of the government, but it really has been that and a lot more,"" he wrote. ""I have served 13 years in the whips' office both in opposition and more recently in government and I have served under and with some fantastic colleagues, notably Patrick [McLoughlin] and Sir George [Young], who have made the job extremely worthwhile and even fun."" Cameron's reply to Randall was glowing, describing him as a ""rock"" for the whips' office and the parliamentary party. ""It sounds dramatic, but I had rather hoped this day would never come,"" Cameron wrote. ""I could not have wished for a more loyal, discreet, patient, trustworthy and committed colleague over the last eight years since I became leader of the party, but you have been all these and much more."" Smith, a Cabinet Office minister, is stepping down to concentrate on her constituency work and engaging young people in politics. The 31-year-old MP, who has previously served as a whip and a Treasury minister, has recently been overseeing the controversial lobbying bill, which has been criticised by charities and campaign groups as posing a potential threat to freedom of speech. She was moved from the Treasury in the last reshuffle shortly after a difficult interview on BBC Newsnight about the chancellor's deferral of fuel duty. Smith, the MP for Norwich North, told the Guardian that her choice to step down was ""to do with priorities and what's most important"". ""Essentially, it's entirely my own decision and something I see as very positive,"" she said. ""Anyone who has known me and my work has known that my constituency comes first. It's the case that I've spent three of my four years in parliament serving as a minister. I'm very proud of that and achieving various things, like helping to save £10bn pounds of Whitehall waste. But for now I want to focus on the things that really matter to me."" In her resignation letter to Cameron, she said: ""As you know, I was only 27 when I was lucky enough to be elected as an MP, and of my four years in parliament so far, I have spent three as a minister. I would welcome the opportunity to develop other ways of giving public service, both inside and outside parliament, while continuing to work hard for my constituents."" The prime minister's reply said Smith has served ""ably"" and made a ""positive impact"". ""I know this will not have been an easy decision for you to make, and one you will have given a huge amount of thought to,"" he said. ""After serving the government so ably for over three years, you will certainly be missed, but I completely understand and respect your decision."" The Tory reshuffle could happen at the same time as shakes up the Labour frontbench. He is thought to be considering moving the shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, and the shadow work and pensions secretary, Liam Byrne, with shadow Treasury minister Rachel Reeves tipped for promotion."

4249	4250	UK set to ban Google Glass for drivers 	" is the highest profile product in a wave of new wearable technologies, promising to display everything from restaurant reviews to directions and allow automated video and photos wherever we go. But the internet-connected eyewear looks set to be banned on the UK's roads even before the product's 2014 launch, according to the Department of Transport. A spokesman for the department told , a gadget magazine, that the device could distract drivers while they are behind the wheel, defining Glass as a similar distraction to a mobile phone. ""We are aware of the impending rollout of Glass and are in discussion with the police to ensure that individuals do not use this technology while driving,"" said the spokesman. ""It is important that drivers give their full attention to the road when they are behind the wheel and do not behave in a way that stops them from observing what is happening on the road."" He pointed to offences including driving without due attention and careless driving, which is due to become a fixed penalty offence in late 2013. Since a ban on using mobile phones while driving was introduced in 2003, more than one million drivers have been convicted – typically issued with a £60 fixed penalty notice and three points on their driver's licence. The statement by the Department for Transport indicates that Google Glass users would be subject to the same penalty under the 1988 Road Traffic Act. It reflects similar concerns in the US, where Glass has been launched to a small trial group of ""explorers"". Politicians in Delaware and West Virginia have that ban drivers wearing computing technologies while driving. ""We are thinking very carefully about how we design Glass because new technology always raises new issues,"" said Google in a statement. ""Our Glass Explorer programme, currently only launched in the US, reaches people from all walks of life and will ensure that our users become active participants in shaping the future of this technology."" Technology fans argue that Glass, which displays simple, monochrome information in the wearer's peripheral vision, is less distracting than satellite navigation tools that include a visual interface designed to be used while driving. Developers have already begun exploring applications for Glass, including , which allows owners of the high-end electric cars to remotely control the car's air conditioning, mileage and battery information as well as directions."

13966	13967	Cardiff City 3-2 Manchester City 	So much for Manuel Pellegrini insisting there was no chance of Manchester City underestimating Cardiff. There was little evidence that message got through to Pellegrini's players on an afternoon that was as chastening for as it was glorious for Cardiff. The Welsh club's first top-flight home game for 51 years will live long in the memory in these parts after two goals from Fraizer Campbell and another from Aron Gunnarsson delivered a thrilling victory. If the result would have been nigh on impossible to predict beforehand, it seemed even more unlikely after Edin Dzeko thumped a wonderful 25-yard shot beyond David Marshall seven minutes into the second half to give the visitors the lead. The natural assumption at that point was that Manchester City, who had looked strangely subdued in the first half, would go through the gears and take the game away from Cardiff. Nothing, however, could have been further from the truth. Cardiff played at a remarkable intensity in the opening 45 minutes and they summoned more courage and spirit to haul themselves back in the game when Gunnarsson swept home to equalise. From then on it was all about Campbell, who caused Manchester City's makeshift defence problems earlier on with his pace but ultimately did the damage here with his head. Campbell twice lost his marker Pablo Zabaleta to nod home from corners, with Joe Hart not exactly covering himself in glory on the first, when the England goalkeeper flapped at Peter Whittingham's delivery. The home team still had to endure a nervous finale. When Alvaro Negredo, a replacement for Dzeko, sent a towering header past Marshall in the second of six minutes of added time, Cardiff were hanging on. Negredo came close to pinching another in the closing seconds but the striker was unable to turn the ball home at the far post and with that chance Pellegrini's hopes of seeing his side salvage a point disappeared. There were raucous scenes at the final whistle as Cardiff supporters celebrated their first home win at this level since a West Ham United team containing Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters were vanquished 3-0 at Ninian Park in 1962. It was a sweet moment for Malky Mackay, his indefatigable players, the supporters who have been through some bleak times and Vincent Tan, the eccentric Cardiff owner who has caused controversy by changing the kit colour but also transformed the club's fortunes. Tan sanctioned £28.7m of spending this summer as Cardiff broke their transfer record three times, yet it was Campbell, a £600,000 signing from Sunderland in January, who stole the show. A surprise England debutant 18 months ago, when Stuart Pearce handed him a full cap against Holland, Campbell has never put forward a convincing case in the past that he belongs at this level. He had managed only seven goals in 70 appearances before the start of this season. By the end of the afternoon, however, the 25-year-old was reminding everyone why Sir Alex Ferguson held him in such high regard when he came through at Manchester United and Mackay was talking about the striker getting back into the England setup. The Cardiff fans certainly made their appreciation known when Campbell departed to a standing ovation in injury-time. For Pellegrini, the inquest will centre on City's poor defending – Joleon Lescott and Javier García never looked comfortable in central defence in the absence of the injured Vincent Kompany – and questions must now be asked about whether Hart is close to reaching that point when he has made one mistake too many. City were also poor in other departments. The fluidity and freedom that characterised their 4-0 win over Newcastle on Monday night was missing against a Cardiff side that worked tirelessly and got their tactics spot on. Mackay crowded the centre of the pitch with players when City had the ball, denying opponents that play narrow and with little natural width the chance to cut through them. On one of the few occasions when Cardiff stood off Manchester City, they were punished. Fernandinho rolled a ball into Sergio Agüero's feet and, with a deft backheel, the Argentinian found Dzeko, who dropped into a pocket of space about 25 yards out. One sumptuous swing of the right boot later and the ball was arching into the top corner of the net. Within eight minutes Cardiff were level. The impressive Kim Bo-kyung escaped on the right flank and delivered a low centre that Campbell swept towards goal. Hart blocked with his feet but Gunnarsson was first to the loose ball and gleefully rammed home. If that was not exactly in the script, it was nothing compared to what followed. Whittingham's corner sailed over the stranded Hart's head and Campbell got in front of Zabaleta, in the 79th minute, to nod in. Three minutes from time Campbell repeated the trick when the substitute Don Cowie delivered an inswinging corner from the opposite side of the pitch. Cardiff were in dreamland and although Negredo's superb header, from David Silva's cross, had a few hearts in mouths, Mackay's players held on for a remarkable win.

11351	11352	Ed Miliband blames rising bills on energy firms overcharging customers 	"Labour leader has dismissed the ""list of excuses"" offered to MPs by energy firms, blaming rising bills on them overcharging hard-pressed customers. He rejected the idea of a Competition Commission investigation into the market, saying ""nothing less than a price freeze"" would do. Miliband, whose promise to freeze bills for 20 months if wins the 2015 election has sent the issue to the top of the political agenda, said what was needed was action rather than a review. He told reporters: ""What we've heard today was a list of excuses from the energy companies."" Responding to chief executive Tony Cocker's call for a Competition Commission investigation, Miliband said: ""We don't need more excuses, more reviews, what we need is action. Action against companies that are overcharging people and taking advantage of a broken market. ""That's why it's so important that we implement Labour's price freeze, which is what we'll do, and reform a broken market so there's proper competition, proper transparency and a regulator who can cut prices for consumers."" He said green levies were not the reason for rising bills, but the charges should offer ""value for money"". Miliband said: ""We should always have value for money in whatever costs there are on bills. But when the companies and the government say that the problems of the cost of living crisis to do with energy aren't to do with overcharging, they are wrong. ""That's why I'll accept nothing less than a price freeze."" Miliband added: ""I think everybody knows by now that the market's not working. There are still some people who are trying to defend that broken market – the energy companies, this government – but I am determined we act. ""Frankly, hard-pressed families need someone who'll stand up for them. That's what I'm doing and that's what I'll do as prime minister."" Energy companies appearing before the energy and climate change select committee on Tuesday insisted the rises in bills were partly down to green taxes, but stood accused of charging customers ""the maximum price they feel they can get away with"". Rising wholesale costs and environmental ""stealth taxes"" were behind the average 9.1% rise announced by some major firms, the committee was told. But the businesses practices of the big six was called into question by small scale competitor Ovo Energy. Managing director Stephen Fitzpatrick told MPs he ""can't explain"" the price rises being imposed because his company was buying gas at a cheaper price – 5p a therm less – than it had in 2009. Loyal bill-payers are charged are a far higher rate, in some cases £200 more, than those who switch but the companies responsible go ""unchallenged"" by Ofgem, he said. ""It looks to me like a lot of energy companies, a significant number of the big six, are charging the maximum price they feel they can get away with to the customers that they feel will not switch under any circumstances and then maintaining the illusion of competitive pricing with tariffs targeted towards a very small number of relatively well-engaged customers,"" he told MPs. ""In the case of NPower, which is the worst offender, historically and today the price differential is about 16%, which is about £200."" He accused British Gas of being the most active in terms of running a dedicated ""win back team"" whose sole job was to call up customers that were leaving to say ""now we can cut your bill"". ""When this kind of behaviour is allowed to go unchallenged, and an ex-monopoly advantage that the big six have, is allowed to go unchallenged by Ofgem, then you will never get effective competition. ""If you don't have effective competition in a retail market then you are always going to be trying to find out where the money has gone and time and time again you will hear very clever, very complex, very confusing answers and you will never get to the bottom of it. ""Effective competition is the only solution to lower bills."" Fitzpatrick has previously suggested that the larger energy companies pay over the odds for energy when their retail arms buy from their own wholesale divisions – a claim the other energy bosses denied on Tuesday. Pressed on the allegation, Tony Cocker, chief executive officer of E.ON, said: ""We buy our electricity and our gas for the retail business from the market via our trading business. ""We operate our businesses on a standalone basis. ""There is absolutely no cross-subsidy between the businesses."" Cocker, who described green schemes as a ""stealth tax"" or ""poll tax"", said E.ON had not yet made a decision on whether to follow the other firms and increase prices. ""We will hold our prices as long as we can,"" he told the MPs, adding that his company faced the same pressures as the other firms, with rises in wholesale and network costs, as well as the social and environmental obligations. He has written to David Cameron calling for a Competition Commission investigation into the industry to be set up to help reassure customers. ""I fundamentally believe that this market is competitive but I acknowledge we are not trusted and therefore I believe we need to have a very thorough Competition Commission investigation,"" he said. William Morris, managing director of SSE, which has announced an 8.2% price rise, said he regretted having to increase bills for customers, who were ""struggling to maintain their budgets"". Transport costs had increased by 10%, while the government's environmental schemes had risen by 13%, he said. ""We would like to see those costs taken off the customers' bills and onto taxation. We welcome the government's decision to review that."" Morris said that companies would reduce bills as quickly as possible if the government decided to scrap the green taxes. Companies have estimated that bills could be cut by around £60 if the green taxes were axed. Guy Johnson, external affairs director of Npower, which has announced average rises of 10.4%, said the largest driver of price rises had been the cost of the so-called climate obligation on power firms. The green taxes cover the period to March 2015, so the energy firms will have to fulfil a large part of their obligation next year, he said. ""That was a concern when we were considering prices for next year."" An analysis by industry regulator Ofgem showed that, while the increases announced so far this autumn by some of the companies have averaged 9.1%, wholesale prices have risen by 1.7% – adding just £10 to the average household bill of £600."

313	314	JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon to be treated for throat cancer 	"JP Morgan Chase CEO , a feisty leader who steered the banking company through the perils of the Great Recession, is battling throat cancer. The condition is considered to be curable, according to a memo to Chase & Co employees and shareholders that Dimon released late Tuesday. Dimon, 58, said he plans to remain on the job and be actively involved in key decisions while undergoing radiation and chemotherapy treatment. The eight-week treatment will begin soon at Memorial Sloan Kettering hospital in New York. The cancer remains confined to Dimon's throat and adjacent lymph nodes on the right side of his neck, according to the memo. ""I feel very good now and will let all of you know if my health situation changes,"" Dimon said. Despite the words of reassurance, Dimon's illness could raise leadership concerns at one of the world's biggest banks. Those worries could be magnified by a recent succession of departures among high-ranking JP Morgan Chase executives once considered to be Dimon's potential successor. The list of defections have included former co-chief operating officer Frank Bisignano and former investment banking head Michael Cavanagh, who had been known as Dimon's ""Mr Fix-it."" JPMorgan's stock fell 37 cents to $57.20 in Tuesday's extended trading. Dimon, JPMorgan's CEO for the past eight-and-half years, won praise for his savvy in the aftermath of the mortgage-market meltdown that nearly toppled the banking industry before miring the U.S. in its deepest recession since World War II. His reputation, though, was tarnished in 2012 by the revelation of a stunning $6 billion loss triggered by risky bets made on complex debt securities by a JPMorgan trader in London. The setback, known as JPMorgan's ""London Whale,"" contributed to an unsuccessful shareholder campaign last year to separate the jobs of chairman and CEO — duties that Dimon still holds. JPMorgan also reached a settlement with the Justice Department last year that required the bank to pay $13bn to cover losses from the sale of toxic mortgages that later collapsed in value. Another legal settlement negotiated last year required JPMorgan to dole out $4.5bn to investors in bundles of shoddy home loans. JPMorgan said most of those troublesome mortgages were inherited from investment bank Bear Stearns and savings and loan Washington Mutual, companies that Dimon negotiated to buy during the financial crisis of 2008. Even amid public outrage over bankers' role in the mortgage meltdown, Dimon remained one of the industry's staunchest advocates. He supported big paydays for bankers and derided some of the U.S. government's proposed reforms designed to minimize the chances of another financial crisis. JPMorgan's stock is up 45% since Dimon took over the bank's helm on 31 December 2005. The S&P 500, meanwhile, has risen 58% in that period."	Business
9019	9020	Nicola Sturgeon: vote for SNP is not vote for second independence referendum 	Nicola Sturgeon has insisted that a vote for the Scottish National party in next month’s general election does not amount to a vote for a second referendum on Scottish independence. The SNP leader was speaking as she visited party activists in Aberdeen city centre in advance of Wednesday night’s second televised Scottish leaders’ debate. In a debate on STV on Tuesday, Sturgeon if it wins the 2016 Holyrood elections on a manifesto promising a second vote. Sturgeon was asked by broadcasters if she regretted mentioning the possibility of a second independence referendum during the debate, but she said she did not. Repeating her line that the timing of another referendum would be decided by public opinion, she said: “It’s ultimately up to the Scottish people. That’s the fundamental democratic point. I can’t impose it on the people against their will.” Sturgeon was booed by some parts of the audience when she said, when pressed by the host Bernard Ponsonby: “If the people of don’t vote for a party with a commitment in a manifesto to a referendum, there won’t be another referendum, that’s the point I’m making. The people are in charge, not politicians.” Scotland voted by 55% to 45% to remain within the UK last September, following a hard-fought campaign that saw support for independence reach an all-time high. In Aberdeen, she again refused to rule out including a referendum in the SNP’s manifesto for the 2016 Holyrood elections, saying: “It’s not reasonable to ask me to write the 2016 manifesto when we haven’t even written the 2015 one.” But she insisted: “A vote for the SNP is not a vote for another referendum. It is a vote to have Scotland’s voice heard at Westminster.” The debate on Wednesday, hosted by the BBC, is due to include the Scottish Green party leader, Patrick Harvie; Ukip’s David Coburn, the Scottish Labour leader, Jim Murphy; the Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson and Willie Rennie for the Liberal Democrats. Sturgeon was heckled by a group of Ukip supporters chanting “Ukip OK”, but they were swiftly drowned out by the boos of the assembled throng of SNP activists at Tuesday’s debate. She said that the back-to-back debates were a chance to put the case for Scotland’s voice being heard more loudly at Westminster. “I want to see an alternative to austerity, I want to see money being spent on the future of our children, not on new nuclear weapons.” she said. “I want more action to grow our economy and create jobs. I want to see a higher minimum wage. These are the kind of policies that a big SNP team in Westminster can help to bring about.” Murphy was also campaigning in Aberdeen ahead of the debate, highlighting the threat of further cuts to disability benefits.

2638	2639	Clegg attacks ‘us-versus-them’ narrative of Farage and Salmond 	British politics is threatened by a divisive “us-versus-them” approach championed by Nigel Farage and which offers a “false comfort of grievance” to voters, Nick Clegg has warned. In his speech to the in Glasgow, the deputy prime minister said the Ukip and SNP leaders are making “seductive and beguiling” offers that are no more than a “counsel of despair”. The strong attack on Farage and Salmond, the day before Ukip is likely to win its first Westminster seat in the Clacton byelection, was designed to highlight Clegg’s main pre-election pitch that he leads the only UK party rooted in the centre ground. But the deputy prime minister also directly addressed one of his main personal weaknesses – that he is untrustworthy after his U-turn on university tuition fees – when he admitted that he had damaged trust in politics. Promising that he would “never, ever” make the same mistake again, Clegg said: “In what might be the least fashionable statement made by any party leader this conference season – politicians of every party have fed this growing cynicism by exaggerating and overstating what governments can do. We’ve all done it. I’ve been there. When I apologised for the disappointment and anger caused by our inability to scrap tuition fees, I knew we could never, ever make that mistake again.” In his speech Clegg also: Attacked the home secretary, Theresa May, for suggesting that Lib Dem opposition to the so called “snooper’s charter” is risking the safety of children. “Stop playing party politics with national security,” he told May as he warned that a “big brother state” demanding the storage of information on websites people visit is as threatening as a state that fails to protect children. Accused the Tories of assuming that every worry in the world can be solved by a “big wave of the Union Jack” as he condemned George Osborne’s plan to penalise the working age poor by planning to freeze benefits. Warned that Ed Miliband is promising an unrealistic “nirvana where everyone will be well-off, no one will be out of pocket”. Clegg opened his speech with a strong condemnation of Islamic State whose beheading of Alan Henning and David Haines had given British military forces a “clear single objective”. He said: “To Isil we say this: all you have done is unite the people of Britain – Muslim and non-Muslim, people of all faiths and none – around a single aim. All you have done is give the British forces who are being deployed to Iraq – some of the best professionals in the world – a clear, single objective.” Clegg hailed the result of the Scottish referendum as he quoted the comic pub landlord Al Murray who told the pro-UK rally in Trafalgar Square that there was something wonderfully vague about being British which he called “Brit-Ish”. But the deputy prime minister had harsh words for Salmond and for Farage for seeking to promote a divisive form of politics. He said: “Something very un-British is taking root in our politics. A growing movement of people who want to pull us apart. Salmond, Farage, the bitter tribalism of left and right – in their different ways they’re all doing the same thing. A growing pick-a-side politics, in a world of us-versus-them. Worried about your job? Your business? Your children’s future? Your way of life? No matter, just blame Europe/Brussels/foreigners/immigrants/the English/the South/professional politicians/Westminster/big business/anybody claiming benefits/even onshore wind farms. “Life is so simple when you know who – or what – to blame. It’s seductive and it’s beguiling. That much may even be proved tomorrow, if the people of Clacton give the UK Independence Party an MP. But resentment, the politics of fear, doesn’t pay the bills or create a single job. Claiming to address people’s acute anxiety about the modern world, it provides nothing but the false comfort of grievance. Dressed up as the politics of hope, it is in fact a counsel of despair.”	Politics
10744	10745	Sepp Blatter has spoken: the vote goes on and Qatar will host 2022 World Cup 	"t the $100m headquarters has built for Fifa high on a hill above Zurich, the president of football's world governing body mounted a defiant, embattled and, at points, irritable defence as a tide of corruption allegations lapped at the Fifa gates. When repeating his overarching argument, that he regards as untouchable even by governments, accountable only to its own ""family within"", Blatter even came close to using the phrase Crisis? What crisis? Asked if this is indeed a crisis for Fifa, with two executive committee members suspended and one, , threatening to unleash a ""tsunami"" against Fifa which began on Sunday night with allegations of impropriety against Blatter himself, the president said: ""Crisis? What is a crisis? Football is not in a crisis. We are only in some difficulties, and the difficulties will be solved within the football family."" Despite the extraordinary fallout which has involved 10 of Fifa's 24 executive committee members, including Blatter himself, being accused of corruption offences, Blatter's stance of invincibility remains true. He rejected any suggestion of postponing the presidential election at Wednesday's Fifa's annual congress. There, with his challenger, the Qatari , having withdrawn and now been suspended pending an investigation into an alleged cash-for-votes bribery scandal, Blatter is certain to be waved in, unopposed, for his fourth four-year term as president. The Swiss government is investigating whether it should maintain tax advantages and immunity from anti-corruption treaties which international sports governing bodies, long clustered in the country, enjoy. A British Conservative MP, Damian Collins, on Monday called on politicians around the world to sign up to his five-plank campaign for change at Fifa. But a long-term inquiry in Switzerland and one backbench MP do not constitute pressure great enough to overhaul Fifa. Blatter's performance was an effort to draw Fifa back in line, calling for ""unity and solidarity"" – with him as head of the family. Blatter brushed aside the claim from Warner, a member of the executive committee and president of the Concacaf grouping of Central American, North America and Caribbean football associations, that Blatter had given $1m (£600,000) in cash to Concacaf, and laptops and computers to 13 Caribbean associations, by implication in return for votes. Warner had said the $1m was for Concacaf ""to spend as it wished"", but Blatter replied that in fact it was for two football development projects under Fifa's flagship programme, Goal. Whether the president of Fifa, a month before an election, should really be handing out $1m cheques to voting confederations, and whether, as Michel Platini, president of European football's governing body, Uefa, said on Monday, Blatter does have ""his own budget"" for Goal, were questions not asked or answered. Doubts have long been expressed about the Goal money, which Fifa distributes to its 208 member associations from its vast income, $1.3bn last year, for selling the World Cup commercial rights. There are accusations it is not accountable enough, and too often in reality amounts to largesse dispensed globally to cement Blatter's regime in Zurich. Warner's allegations, made in fury after his suspension was announced by Fifa's ethics committee, included the allegation that in an email to Warner, Jerome Valcke, Fifa's general secretary, had said, almost casually, that ""bought"" the hosting of the 2022 World Cup. That tore open again the rumbling controversy over how Qatar, the tiny but oil and gas-rich Gulf state, won the right to host the 2022 tournament. Valcke attempted a clarification of that incendiary comment with a statement issued just before Blatter's press conference, saying: ""What I wanted to say is that the winning bid used their financial strength to lobby for support. I have at no time made, or was intending to make, any reference to any purchase of votes or similar unethical behaviour."" In his email to Warner, which Warner exposed, Valcke appeared to be witheringly dismissive of Bin Hammam's presidential election candidacy, and wondered whether the Qatari believed he could ""buy Fifa as they [Qatar] bought the WC"". After Qatar were awarded the tournament in December, allegations followed of vote-sharing with Spain, forbidden in the Fifa rules. Then the House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee published evidence from the Sunday Times quoting a Qatari whistleblower saying two African Fifa executive committee members, Issa Hayatou and Jacques Anouma, had been paid bribes to vote for Qatar. Both men denied that, and the Qatar bid team issued a detailed rejection. On Monday Blatter made great play of the fact that he was appearing before the massed ranks of the international media alone – with Valcke absent. Asked about Valcke's comment and the clarification, Blatter refused to discuss it. But he maintained, again, that there will be no investigation or reopening of the bidding process. ""There was no problem for Fifa's executive committee to act, and there is no issue for the World Cup 2022,"" Blatter insisted. Warner had raged in his own statement that the bribery charges against him and Bin Hammam, which led to their suspension, were ""politically motivated"" to secure Blatter's re-election, and he made a dark threat. ""I intend to say a lot more on this matter shortly."" Fifa is bracing itself for further revelations, from the inside, as Warner has been at the heart of Fifa, on the executive committee, for 28 years, working closely with Blatter. Blatter did say he will seek reforms to Fifa's ""governance and compliance"" after the deluge of scandals. He held up a thin, glossy leaflet for the cameras, and said: ""This is our ethics code. I am not sure everybody in the Fifa family has read it."" Then he was gone, still the leader of world football, after all that has happened, untouchable, and cruising to four more years."	Football
2727	2728	SSE to cut dual fuel bills by 3.5% from March 	" became the latest energy firm to announce savings from the government's green levy shake-up with plans to cut dual fuel prices by 3.5% from 24 March. The bill reduction will apply to all SSE's 9.5 million residential customers, including those on fixed or capped deals. But it will only scale back the 8.2% average tariff rise that kicked in on 15 November and the change will also take effect nearly three months after rival British Gas dropped prices in response to the government's move to cut the cost of green levies on customer bills. SSE's announcement follows ScottishPower's decision on Monday to reduce dual fuel prices by 3.3% from 31 January. Npower is now the only ""big six"" provider not to reveal price changes following the green levy deal, although it has already pledged to cut prices. Labour last week called on ScottishPower, npower and SSE to immediately reduce prices for households after the government said it would cut the cost of the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) and asked electricity distribution companies to take action to reduce network costs. British Gas has already reduced prices, announcing in early December that it would lower bills by 3.2% on New Year's Day, effectively reducing hikes that saw prices go up by 10.4% for electricity and 8.4% for gas in November. EDF and E.ON took the levy changes into account in the recent round of price rises, increasing tariffs on average by 3.9% and 3.7% respectively – far less than the increases announced by rivals. But SSE's delay comes as it said it was not expecting the ECO savings to start coming through until April. Like other suppliers, it will also hand a £12 rebate to all electricity customers for the Warm Home Discount, to be funded through general taxation, which together with the price cut will shave around £50 off the average annual dual fuel bill, to £1,174. SSE said it would cap prices at the new, lower level until spring 2015, as long as there were no major increases in wholesale energy costs, network or policy costs."	Business
1149	1150	Sainsbury’s cuts sales forecast and reviews dividend 	The UK’s supermarkets are facing a “perfect storm” of problems, the new boss of Sainsbury’s said as he revealed a slump in sales and warned that the changes under way in the food retail business were the most challenging he had seen in his 30-year career. Just days after announcing a new round of price cuts intended to fend off growing competition from fast-growing discounters including Aldi and Lidl, the Sainsbury’s chief executive, Mike Coupe, said the pace of change in shoppers’ behaviour had accelerated rapidly over the summer. “It’s the most challenging I’ve ever seen the market in my 30 years in retail. A combination of effects have created a perfect storm,” Coupe said. A sea change in shoppers’ behaviour is under way, the scale of which some retail executives and analysts have likened to the arrival of self-service supermarkets in the 1960s. , Morrisons and Sainsbury’s are all seeing sales decline sharply as customers shun superstores and big weekly shopping expeditions in favour of shopping more locally and more often. They are also looking for better deals, trying new retailers, buying less and wasting less. Online shopping is also growing rapidly. Those trends are boosting the discounters – especially Aldi, Lidl and Poundland – and convenience stores, rather than the traditional big supermarkets. is the only one of the big four grocers gaining market share – and its gains are tiny compared with those of the discounters. The Walmart-owned chain cut its prices sooner than its rivals, which are only now realising they must respond. “These are trends that are here to stay,” said Coupe. “Customers have never been more savvy or shopping around more.” It was Coupe’s first update to the City since he replaced Justin King as boss in July. He said Sainsbury’s was carrying out a complete review of its business to find a way to fight back: “We are looking at all aspects of our business. We will leave no stone unturned.” The company said it was not standing still in the face of new competition but was opening more convenience stores and improving its online service, both of which were seeing sales rise. It also plans to fight the discounters head on through a deal with the Danish discounter Netto to open Netto shops in the UK. The first five will open at the beginning of next month. However, more than £1bn was wiped off the value of the UK’s three publicly listed supermarkets – Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and Tesco – yesterday as Coupe admitted that Sainsbury’s takings would continue to decline in the coming months. Sainsbury’s shares slumped nearly 7% to their lowest level in 11 years. Retail analysts at the City broker Shore Capital slashed their full-year profits forecasts for Sainsbury’s by 17% to £650m. If Sainsbury’s shares fall just 17p from yesterday’s 234p close, they will be back to their level in 1989. Investors have also been spooked by the £250m accounting scandal at Tesco in relation to the allocation of payments from suppliers, which is being investigated by the City watchdog. But Coupe and Sainsbury’s finance chief, John Rogers, insisted they were “100% confident” that Sainsbury’s had accounted for promotional income correctly. Rogers said it was “a gross misrepresentation” that retailers had lots of leeway about how and when to record such income. The accounting rules, he insisted, were clearly defined. Retail experts had been braced for bad news on sales and Sainsbury’s confirmed those fears. Like-for-like sales – which measure only stores open for a full year to exclude gains made from opening new shopfloor space – dropped by 2.8% over the past four months. In the previous three months, sales declined by 1.1%. Before that Sainsbury’s had recorded nine years of unbroken quarterly sales growth. Coupe insisted that Sainsbury’s was outperforming Tesco and Morrisons, both of which have seen sales dive more sharply. But Darren Shirley, an analyst at Shore Capital, said this was hardly an achievement. “Should Sainsbury’s be comparing itself with the two weakest performers in the market?” he asked Morrisons has been forced to accept a 50% cut in its profits in order to slash prices on more than 1,200 items after it began losing sales to discount stores. Tesco is in turmoil after replacing its chief executive and finance director after a big slump in performance in the UK and overseas. The UK’s biggest retailer has found itself hindered by its reliance on very large supermarkets which are now out of fashion. “You could argue that with Tesco underperforming to that degree, Sainsbury’s should be benefiting – and they are not,” Shirley said.

2046	2047	Calvin Harris' Summer single is a million-dollar hit on Spotify 	Streaming music service Spotify says the aptly-named Summer by was its “song of the summer” this year, after its users streamed the track more than 160m times since its release in June. Announced as part of a wider release about summer hits on the service – Harris beat Ariana Grande and Iggy Azalea’s Problem to top spot on Spotify’s chart – the feat becomes more interesting when you dig in to how much money Summer’s streams made for Harris. The short answer: nobody knows, because the exact amount will depend on the terms of his label and publishing contracts. But we can at least calculate roughly how much those rightsholders were paid for streams of the song. in 2013, including the claim that its average “per stream” payout is between $0.006 and $0.0084. Those figures cover payments to labels, publishers and distributors, who then pass them on to artists and songwriters. According to the , Harris’ Summer has been played 160,753,376 times, at the time of writing. That means a payout of between $964k and $1.35m so far. Or, if you take the mid-point between the two per-stream amounts: around $1.16m (around £706k). It’s a million-dollar hit on , at least, since these figures don’t include payments for streams of the track on YouTube (42.7m plays of the audio-only version and another 189.1m of the actual video) or other streaming services. Global download sales of Summer are unknown. Only Harris will know how much of Summer’s streaming payout comes through to him, and even he won’t know for a while, since royalty payments don’t tend to zip through the music industry system at a rollercoaster pace. These calculations don’t prove the arguments of Spotify’s keenest supporters or fiercest foes regarding streaming’s pros and cons for musicians: you could spin the figures either way, depending on your existing view. But the numbers are an insight into the scale of payouts for the biggest hits on this particular streaming service – although Summer has a way to go to catch up with Avicii’s Wake Me Up, which with 277.1m streams so far remains the biggest hit on Spotify.

121	122	YouTube to block indie labels who don't sign up to new music service 	"Independent artists could disappear from ""in a matter of days"" after the Google video service confirmed it was dropping content from independent labels that have not signed up for its upcoming subscription music service. YouTube is about to begin testing the new service – which will charge people to watch and listen to music without ads, and download songs to their mobile devices – within the next few days, initially within . The company's head of content and business operations, Robert Kyncl, that the service – previously rumoured to be called YouTube Music Pass – will launch more widely later in the year. His confirmation that YouTube will block videos from labels that do not sign licensing deals for the new premium tier will be hugely controversial among indie labels, with trade body WIN already filing a complaint to the European Commission about its negotiating strategy. ""While we wish that we had 100% success rate, we understand that is not likely an achievable goal and therefore it is our responsibility to our users and the industry to launch the enhanced music experience,"" said Kyncl, claiming that YouTube has signed up labels representing 90% of the music industry. Independent labels are likely to disagree. Their licensing agency Merlin estimates that of the recorded music industry's sales and streams. Contacted by The Guardian following his comments, WIN's chief executive Alison Wenham was blunt in her response. ""They have suffered a simple but catastrophic error of judgement in misreading the market,"" said Wenham, who had to protest at YouTube's plans. Wenham said YouTube was ""setting itself up for failure"" and only a small number of independent labels would agree to its terms. ""We have tried and will continue to try to help YouTube understand just how important independent music is to any streaming service and why it should be valued accordingly. Music fans want a service that offers the complete range of music available. This is something that companies such as Spotify and Deezer do, both of whom have excellent relationships with the independent music sector,"" she said. WIN claims that the company has signed lucrative licensing deals with major labels Universal, Warner and Sony, while demanding that independent labels sign up to inferior terms or face having their videos blocked from YouTube's free service. “Our goal is to continue making YouTube an amazing music experience, both as a global platform for fans and artists to connect, and as a revenue source for the music industry,” a Google spokesman said. He said the subscription-based service would bring new revenue streams “in addition to the hundreds of millions of dollars YouTube already generates for them each year. We are excited that hundreds of major and independent labels are already partnering with us.” Wenham's criticism echoes a claim made at the event by musician Billy Bragg, who said ""I don’t know why they’ve opened this hornet’s nest right now, apart from corporate hubris. I don’t think they realise what a stupid thing they’ve done."" Artists including Adele, Arctic Monkeys and Jack White could see their videos taken down. The site has become a key promotional outlet for independent labels of all sizes in recent years. YouTube attracts more than 1bn monthly viewers, with music one of its biggest categories. Its upcoming premium music subscription tier will compete with Spotify, Deezer and Napster among other services, including Apple-owned Beats Music and Google's own Google Play Music All Access. Independent labels have long complained that they deserve more respect from digital music services negotiating licensing deals, and set up Merlin to strike deals on their behalf. The agency has remained silent throughout the recent arguments about YouTube's planned new service, although its chief executive Charles Caldas in late April. Referring to an earlier quote from Bragg suggesting that musicians unhappy about royalties paid by Spotify should be ""marching to YouTube central with flaming pitchforks"", Caldas said: ""I can’t say Billy’s right, but I can say that he’s not wrong."" The move comes as Amazon too has begun to flex its muscles in ways that limit the content its customers can receive. Amazon is delaying shipments and , publisher of Harry Potter author JK Rowling, and home to David Baldacci, Stephen Colbert, David Foster Wallace and others. It has also for forthcoming Warner Home Video features, including international blockbuster The Lego Movie, 300: Rise of an Empire, Winter’s Tale and Transcendence. "	Technology
8743	8744	Hillsborough: 20 years on, Liverpool has still not forgiven the newspaper it calls 'The Scum' 	"The front page of Britain's best-selling tabloid newspaper read ""96 Tears"" on Thursday, the headline over a story about the previous day's moving tribute to the Hillsborough dead. Not that many people on Merseyside saw it. The newspaper, which has a circulation of more than 3m nationally, sold just 8,000 copies in the area on the day of the memorial service at Anfield, which was attended by more than 30,000 people. Inside the newspaper, still known as ""The Scum"" in Liverpool, ""lifelong fan"" David Wooding, the Whitehall editor, delivered a poignant tribute to the men, women and children who lost their lives. But for those who gathered at Anfield this week, it was far too little and far too late. At the Albert pub, squeezed next to the ground, football scarves and Liverpool memorabilia cover the walls and ceiling. The entrance of the pub has a poster mocking the front page of the Sun's notorious splash, which appeared a few days after the tragedy. The tabloid's masthead appears to be dripping in blood. ""The truth,"" it reads. ""96 dead. Hillsborough 15th April 1989. Don't buy the Sun."" Tommy Doran, who works at the Albert, remembers one regular reading the Sun in a corner of the pub. ""I went over to him and said: 'What's that?' and he went: 'The Sun.' I just ripped it up into pieces in front of him."" Like many others on Merseyside, Doran will never forgive the decision of then editor Kelvin MacKenzie to lead on 19 April 1989 with a story headlined ""The Truth"" that was anything but. In it, quoting unnamed police sources and a Tory MP, it claimed drunken Liverpool fans urinated on and picked the pockets of the dead, hampered rescue efforts and attacked policemen. Lord Taylor's subsequent report into the tragedy later made it clear that it was the decision to open a gate to ease a crush outside the ground and a failure to direct fans away from the central pen once inside that was the main cause. The Sun's slurs still linger and, according to some relatives of the victims, hampered a fight for justice that goes on to this day. The hatred they feel for the paper still burns fiercely and the Sun has all but given up trying to repair relations. Sun reporters know they will never get exclusives from former players who remember the disaster and its effect. Current players such as Steven Gerrard, who lost a cousin in the disaster, are similarly aware of the sensitivities involved. Some at the paper believe it became the target for the anger of fans partly because of the failure of officials to accept responsibility. Managing editor Graham Dudman wrote two weeks ago: ""Despite some members of the Hillsborough Family Support Group publicly accepting our apology, it made little difference on Merseyside where the community has to live with the knowledge that no police officer or ground official was ever convicted for the mistakes that led to the tragedy."" For most, the time for apologies has long gone. Tom Hughes, a Liverpool fan, said: ""I would never buy it and people round here won't buy it again for another 20 years. It has gone too far. There has been the apology from Kelvin MacKenzie then he took it back saying he was forced to apologise. What does that say to people?"" Mackenzie admitted the story was a ""fundamental mistake"" before a Commons committee in 1993. But at a private lunch in 2006, he suggested he had only apologised because Rupert Murdoch forced him to and was quoted as saying: ""All I did wrong was tell the truth ... I was not sorry then and I'm not sorry now."" In 2004, there was a concerted push by the Sun to try to move on from what it called ""the most terrible mistake in its history"" but many agreed with the Liverpool Echo's condemnation of it as a ""cynical and shameless"" exercise. Dudman went to Liverpool for informal talks with members of the Hillsborough Families Support Group but a formal approach to speak to the group was rejected. ""Do you forgive Hitler for what he's done? Does anybody forgive Pol Pot? We are not God,"" said Margaret Aspinall, who lost her 18-year-old son at Hillsborough. ""I cannot forgive people like that. And that Sun newspaper, may God forgive them - not me."" Kelvin MacKenzie ignores the pleas of senior colleagues and plumps for a front page headline reading The Truth, with three sub-headings: ""Some fans picked pockets of victims; Some fans urinated on the brave cops; Some fans beat up PC giving kiss of life"". MacKenzie is persuaded by Rupert Murdoch to apologise. Appearing in front of a Commons select committee, MacKenzie said: ""I regret Hillsborough. It was a fundamental mistake. The mistake was I believed what a (Tory) MP said."" After the Sun pays Wayne Rooney a six-figure sum for a series of exclusive interviews following Euro 2004, he is criticised in his home town of Liverpool. In response, the Sun carries a full page apology for ""the most terrible mistake in its history"" but also claims the campaign has been stirred up by the Trinity Mirror-owned Liverpool Echo. At a private business lunch at a Newcastle law firm MacKenzie is reported to have retracted his apology: ""I wasn't sorry then and I'm not sorry now because we told the truth."" MacKenzie, appearing on Question Time, says he shouldn't have to apologise. ""The issue about it is that story has become so caught up in a battle ... that actually no matter what I said would resolve the issue."""	Football
14625	14626	Mhairi Black: the 20-year-old student poised to unseat Douglas Alexander 	A self-confessed political “geek” and football obsessive, Mhairi Black – like any university student – is happier in jeans than in the smart business suits she is having to get used to wearing. “My mum insisted,” said the 20-year-old. “We went shopping the minute I was selected.” In the concrete car park directly across from the ancient abbey of Paisley – resting place of the royal house of Stuart and a place where 19th-century radicals once plotted an overthrow of the government – Black’s supporters are more warmly dressed in Puffa jackets and scarves. The evening sunshine is giving way to drizzle and a chilly wind. Black must be freezing as she takes out her Scottish National party rosette and pins it to her lapel, but beams warmly. “Right, at least its drier than last night. So where are we going?” If the pollsters are accurate, Black could be going all the way to Westminster. , Black is 8% ahead of her rival. Victory would be a remarkable feat and make the SNP candidate for Paisley and Renfrewshire South the youngest ever MP, as well as overturn the 16,610 majority of one of Labour’s biggest hitters in Scotland, shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander. Referring to its radical traditions, Benjamin Disraeli once said: “Keep your eye on Paisley.” Students of political upsets would do well to heed the advice on 7 May. As Black canvasses round an estate of modern terraced houses in central Paisley, a town some seven miles west of Glasgow, everyone who answers their door has an opinion. “You’re kind of young to be taking on a big gun,” said Joseph Findlay, a lifelong voter. But he’s prepared to listen and takes the literature he’s offered. “I think the SNP will win round here,” he said. “As long as David Cameron is put out, that’s the main thing.” Findlay is the only one who mentions her age, but everyone has something to say – about welfare, the NHS, dirty pavements, tax, even euthanasia. Though slightly startled by her own trajectory, Black is not remotely surprised by the SNP surge. “People have been battered by a system that doesn’t care about them and they’ve had enough of austerity,” she said. “You can feel the frustration that people have, that the principles have been abandoned by Labour. My dad is a lifelong Labour voter: my family was all proper Clydeside-shipyards Labour. But my grandfather would turn in his grave if he heard how Labour were behaving now: the bitterness in them. The intellect of the party has fallen, the principles of the party have fallen. They started taking people for granted. My dad and I joined the SNP on the same day. Labour have never had to campaign here, so I wanted to stand to force to do just that.” Alexander, in charge of Labour’s national election strategy, knows he is in a battle now. The membership of the SNP has tripled in the past six months to more than 106,000 – the party claims 1,200 people signed up during Thursday’s television leadership debate in which its leader, Nicola Sturgeon, starred. It has become the third largest party by membership in Britain. For Black, the legacy of Scotland’s in/out referendum is a renewed political energy and determination, and a growing self-confidence among those who want to shape its own destiny. “It took a day or two to lick my wounds, and then I just thought: right, what can I do now? And a lot of people were like that. People had a confidence, that capability. You knew that you could be a painter and decorator and know more about what needs to be done in this society than anyone in a suit in Westminster. Because you know what it is to be skint and to live with the anxieties of that in your life. That’s what the Labour party used to stand for. We don’t need to be millionaires, we just want to be making a decent living and having our views listened to. “It’s about making a noise, whether writing to your MP or going on a march. I’ve got a lot of friends who live in England who are really jealous of what’s happening in Scotland, who would love to be part of something like this.” My grandfather would turn in his grave if he heard how Labour were behaving now: the bitterness in them Black tackled the selection process in the way she is tackling the election: singlemindedly. The first girl in her primary school to be selected for the football team, she clearly has determination and drive. But it was just a day after her selection that the first hard political knock came. In what seems an oversight by the SNP PR machine, Black’s Twitter account still held tweets from when she was a teenager. During an especially tense match between her beloved Partick Thistle and rivals Celtic, she had tweeted: “I’ve only just realised – I really f***** hate Celtic” and “Celtic, yer a joke! #scum.” “Yes, making the front page was a surprise,” she said ruefully. “My brother came through and said: ‘Have you seen this?’ But then he said: ‘You got a bit heated during a football match. Tony Blair started a war. Let’s put it in perspective.’ “So it was a shock to the system, but you have to think about what your political opponents are doing, trawling through to find old messages written by a teenager and holding them relevant in a country where 100,000 children are living below the poverty line. Maybe their priorities are a bit skewed.” That wasn’t the end of the controversy. At a post-referendum rally, Black described being at the count and walking past “all these fatcat Labour councillors goading us, clapping sarcastically, saying ‘better luck next time’ or ‘hard lines’. It took everything, every fibre in my being, not to put the nut in one of them.” Unfortunately for her, the cameras were rolling. “Of course, I regret that turn of phrase,” she says now. “That day, after two years of work, of course it was emotional. And no, I wasn’t about to headbutt anyone.” On his doorstep, Paisley voter Joseph Findlay is impressed with Black. He’s never before voted SNP, but he’s now considering it, disillusioned with Labour. “I think they judged it wrong, they scared people and that’s not right. There’s a lot regretting it now. “I voted Labour all my life, my wife voted no in the referendum, and I voted yes. She’s riddled with guilt now she sees that nothing has changed. We’re both not decided yet for the general election but I think the SNP are going to win around here. “Us oldyins haven’t done much to put up a fight, so now the younger ones are getting out and doing it for themselves.” He peers round his doorframe at the departing figure of Black, off to “chap” his neighbour’s door. “Very good luck to the lassie.” If the directness of the voters around here is anything to go by, there is no tolerance for the status quo. Alexander may yet pull back some of his party’s deserters before the vote, but there is a new wave of post-referendum politicised Scots who won’t make it easy. Black refuses to even think about losing. “I’m fighting this election day by day, talking to as many people as I possibly can. I want to change things, that’s what people are demanding. You can feel it bubbling – the frustration and the anger.”	Politics
3975	3976	Arsenal 2-1 Barcelona 	Arsenal may not have won the tie but they approach the return with a serenity that is no longer within Barcelona's reach. The visitors lost a lead and then the match. In that run of events an initially effortless side became careless and vulnerable. They ought to reproach themselves and there is now penance enough in a return at the Camp Nou that will be stressful for Barcelona no matter how it is eventually resolved. For the time being Arsène Wenger can settle for feeling proud of the maturity of Arsenal players whose temperaments did not shrivel even when were at their most intimidatingly fluent. Instead Arsenal persevered in looking for weaknesses and eventually located them. Robin van Persie tied the score in the 78th minute with a drive from a tight angle on the left that ought never to have beaten Víctor Valdés at his near post. There was further proof to come of Barcelona fallibility. Five minutes later Cesc Fábregas set Samir Nasri moving on the right and the cut-back was swept home perfectly by the substitute Andrey Arshavin. Barcelona had come as close as seems feasible to resembling normal, intermittently accident-prone human beings. Chances were squandered as if it could be taken for granted that there would be many more to come for Lionel Messi and others. That assumption turned out to be a delusion and now there are matters of bare fact to occupy them. The centre-half Gerard Piqué was booked and will be suspended for the second leg. The Barcelona manager, Pep Guardiola, must therefore hope that the captain Carles Puyol's recovery from a knee injury does not falter between now and 8 March. There was proof in abundance of Barcelona's technique and imagination, yet they were not ruthless in taking the full benefit. They had been 2-0 ahead here a year ago before drawing the first leg of the quarter-final but went on to rout 4-1 in the return. That may account for the complacency when Barcelona neglected to drive home the advantage of David Villa's opener last night. Arsenal's emergence as the single likely challenger to Manchester United for the Premier League title ought to have told Barcelona that there is more of an edge to Wenger's men nowadays. With an away goal recorded in a narrow defeat Guardiola's side deserve to remain favourites for the quarter-finals but that assertion is open to more debate now than anyone anticipated. Meeting Barcelona is a predicament for virtually all teams but Arsenal's case is unusual. Rather than being the normal contrast of styles, this encounter saw Guardiola's side taking on opponents who would like nothing better than to emulate their methods. Arsenal withstood that comparison. Even when the visitors took the lead through Villa in the 26th minute it came in a spell where they might just as easily have fallen behind. Neither team was particularly convincing when seeking to thwart the other. Their heart is not in such work. That openness made for a frenetic yet also adroit spectacle. Barcelona could well have had a lovingly crafted opener after a quarter of an hour. Andrés Iniesta picked out Messi and he laid the ball back to Villa before breaking free on the return. It may only have been the wish to take the goal with a flourish that undermined him as a dinked shot went beyond the far post. Arsenal were at least as effective then in unpeeling a back four. Following good work by Theo Walcott, Fábregas lobbed a pass to Van Persie, who rattled a shot that was saved by Valdés. Even if Wenger's men blundered in their effort to spring the offside trap, Messi sending Villa in for the opener, Arsenal had been trying to dictate the terms of the match and so break a Barcelona rhythm that is as natural as a pulse. There had been indications from early moments that Barcelona are less sure in defence without Puyol. In that aspect the visitors could be seen as fallible human beings. They were not in full command when a run like Walcott's unpeeled the right side of the defence in the 55th minute, although his low ball was cleared. There was enough disquiet in Barcelona for Piqué to receive his yellow card, after bringing down Fábregas. There was a gathering conviction to Arsenal and, in consequence, the odd indication of alarm in the visitors as the second half assumed its shape. It took 20 minutes or more before Barcelona enjoyed a studied period of possession as they probed around the edges of the Arsenal penalty area. Two substitutions reflected managerial outlooks. Guardiola's preference was conservative, as Seydou Keita took over from Villa, while Wenger pitched on the creative Arshavin for the holding midfielder Alex Song. The match had turned pensive. That was natural after two sides who had regularly swept around this pitch realised that they resemble normal footballers in one respect. They, too, can get very tired. Arsenal still mustered a perseverance that took them to victory.	Football
14096	14097	Tories winning economy 'blame game' – poll 	"In the run-up to next week's budget, the retain a commanding lead on the economic ""blame game"" and appear to be containing the Ukip insurgency, according to a Guardian/ICM poll. Westminster voting intentions have changed little , with Labour still ahead on 38% and the Conservatives creeping up one point to 35%, narrowing Ed Miliband's lead to just three points. But Ukip, which has had exceptional exposure in the run-up to May's European elections, not all of it flattering, has dropped back two points to 9%. As Nick Clegg prepares to , the Lib Dems have clawed back two points from their 16-year low in . Clegg's party's rise to 12% has pushed Farage's party back into fourth place. It is only the third time since George Osborne's ""omnishambles"" 2012 budget that the Tories have hit 35% or more in the monthly series of polls. David Cameron's relatively solid standing today comes after months of good economic news: and inflation for the first time in four years. In these circumstances, voters appear to be in a forgiving mood about the preceding years of disappointing financial news and the continuing cuts. ICM asked who or what was ""most to blame for Britain's recent economic difficulties and the ongoing cutbacks in government spending"", and found that twice as many voters (32%) blamed ""debts racked up by the last government"" as the ""coalition's economic management"" (16%). Labour has during the course of this parliament, and the gap between government and opposition on this score is now the widest it has been since 2010. Labour's 16-point deficit represents a substantial widening of the six-point gap found the last time a similarly worded question was put in . More people (20%) now blame the banks than the coalition, while the proportion of voters who identify the eurozone as the principal culprit (14%) is nearly as high as those who point the finger at the government. While the Financial Times has warned that Osborne in his accounts, the poll is a propitious political backdrop for a chancellor preparing to open his budget red box next Wednesday. But the survey contains warnings that the most talked-about giveaways in prospect are out of line with the public's priorities. Coalition Conservatives and are scrambling to claim credit for increases to the personal allowance, and Clegg identified further increases in his spring conference speech last weekend. Yet the ICM survey finds that only 16% of voters regard this as their top priority. Even less popular is an alternative income tax cut being pushed by : an increase to the £42,000 entry-point for the 40% tax bracket. Only 4% of voters picked this budget option off the menu. Even among Conservative voters, a mere 5% prioritised this option. Far more popular than either of these initiatives would be to plough extra resources into the NHS – the priority for 31% of voters – or to cut the 20% VAT rate that the coalition imposed (19%). The Lib Dems say higher allowances help the low-paid, but almost as many voters – 14% – would prefer a pause in tax credit cuts, a more targeted help for the working poor. As Osborne weighs fiscal arithmetic which some economists claim will mean that austerity, originally meant to last for only one parliament, will now have to continue through until 2020, the poll contains definite signs of voters losing patience with retrenchment. Whereas the chancellor has consistently insisted that reducing the deficit must take priority over early tax cuts, only 7% of respondents believe that if the Treasury finds itself with money to play with, the first thing to do should be repay government debt. That finding will embolden Tory backbenchers and activists, who insist that voters need to start seeing some sort of return in their pockets from all the years of austerity. The vote share of assorted minor parties in today's poll is 7%, comprising 2% each for the Scottish and Welsh nationalists, and 3% for the Green party. Surveys of voters are typically seen as popularity polls. Tuesday's Guardian/ICM survey digs into the mood of the times by probing political unpopularity. Since August, the race between Labour and the Conservatives has been pretty steady. Labour briefly bounced up after to cap energy bills at his party's conference, but other than that his lead has been remarkably consistent at three or four percentage points – the margin in six of the last eight surveys, including today's. Just over a year from a general election, the question is whether the public has simply made up its mind, or whether a great Ukip surge, a swing back to the Tories, or anything else could disrupt the equilibrium. The potential for voters to switch their loyalties is often driven by the depths of their dislikes. ICM asked voters to rate parties' likeability on a 1-7 scale, and found – unsurprisingly – that all were more disliked (indicated by an answer of 1-3) than liked (a rating of 5-7). Labour is currently the least disliked, but even its balance is negative: 40% dislike it, while 36% feel warmly towards it. For the Tories, the 49%-30% balance is much more negative. Things are worse still for the Lib Dems – disliked by 54%, liked by only 20% – and even more so for Ukip, where the ""dislikes"" enjoy a 58% to 19% edge. The 35% who dislike Ukip ""a lot"" (rating it 1) is far higher than for any other party, indicating limits to the appeal of Nigel Farage's anti-politically correct persona. Parties, and particularly parties of the right perhaps, comfort themselves that while they may be unloved, they can win support by being respected. So ICM also asked voters about whom they could imagine supporting. This approach also suggested that Labour is fishing in the biggest pond – only 37% say they ""could never vote"" for Labour, as against 45% for the Tories. In past years, the Lib Dems picked up support from all sides, but after seeing them govern in coalition, more people (56%) would automatically rule them out than the Tories. Again, however, it is the limits of Ukip's appeal that comes through most clearly of all: 59% say they could never lend Farage their support in a general election. Of course, May's European elections are another matter, but with 62% of even Tory voters saying they could never back Ukip at Westminster, it is hard to imagine it breaking the political mould. On the other hand, the Tories face grave difficulties in winning back support already lost to Ukip – 59% of Ukip voters say they could never vote for the Tories, against a mere 38% who say they would consider it. A considerably higher proportion of Lib Dems (47%) say they might be tempted into the Tory fold, and the smaller sliver of the Labour vote (25%) is more significant, both because the Labour pool of supporters is larger, and because of the way the electoral system works. All told, the poll suggests that the number of voters that the Tories might hope to snatch from Labour and the Lib Dems is roughly four times larger than the number of Ukip voters who might embrace David Cameron – which highlights the dangers for him in obsessing about his right flank at the expense of the middle ground."

1712	1713	Home rule within UK best for Scotland, says former Labour first minister 	"The former Labour first minister Jack McConnell has set out a positive case for Scottish home rule within the UK, arguing that a dislike of David Cameron is not a good enough reason to vote yes to independence. Speaking to an audience of Better Together supporters in Edinburgh on the 15th anniversary of the opening of the Scottish parliament in 1999, McConnell said the campaign had become unnecessarily polarised between nationalism and unionism. ""It doesn't reflect modern ,"" he said. ""It's time for those of us who played such a big part in creating home rule inside the UK and also making it work to come out fighting for it."" McConnell was one of the leaders of the successful yes campaign in the devolution referendum of 1997. In the speech – his first significant intervention in the independence referendum campaign – McConnell insisted that home rule was not ""a compromise, a tactic or all we can achieve"". Repeating Barack Obama's famous slogan ""yes we can"", he said Scotland was a healthier, economically stronger and more confident place after 15 years of devolution, citing the smoking ban, the growth in renewable energy and the formation of the National Theatre of Scotland. Asked whether the Scottish parliament could expect further powers from Westminster in the event of a no vote, he called for a ""conference of the new union"" to reconsider the way the UK is governed and address the centralisation of power, but said this would be unrealistic before the general election of 2015. Pro-union parties have yet to offer voters any detailed cross-party commitment to more devolution if the no campaign is successful. McConnell, who stepped back from after his time as first minister ended in 2007, said the only person who had ever broken a promise on the offer of more powers was Margaret Thatcher, and she had ""paid a price in Scotland"". The phrase ""home rule"" has become popular in recent weeks, in particular with Labour supporters of the no campaign. On the latest leg of his 100 Towns in 100 Days tour in Falkirk on Monday, the shadow secretary of state for international development, Jim Murphy, acknowledged: ""Home rule is a much more powerful phrase than devolution."" On Tuesday new polling from YouGov showed an increase in support for the no side, with 35% saying they would vote yes if the referendum were tomorrow, compared with 54% who would vote no and 12% who were either undecided or would not vote. One of a series of polls for the Times, the results showed an increase of two points in the no vote since March, and a decrease of two points for the yes side. The results for female voters, a key constituency in this referendum campaign, remained static since March with 62% in favour of remaining in the union, compared to 38% voting for independence, excluding those who are undecided. This compares with ICM polling for Scotland on Sunday which found a rise in support for independence particularly marked among female voters, previously less likely to be drawn to yes, with an increase of five percentage points since May."

381	382	The eking out of the Hobbit franchise offers poor value for fans 	"""This is one for the fans!"" screamed Quentin Tarantino in self-congratulatory mode, during a 2001 interview on the subject of his forthcoming samurai epic Kill Bill. The film was set to compensate loyal followers for years of creative inertia, so it seemed more than a little odd when he later split the movie in two at the behest of its producers. His beloved fans would now be expected to pay for two separate tickets and wait an extra six months to see Bill meet his maker, and all to ensure a larger box office take for backers Miramax Films. The reaction was far from appreciative. Fast-forward a decade and last year's announcement that The Hobbit – just 310 pages long in book form – would be stretched across three lengthy epics was met with a fan reaction verging on the priapic. So when did audiences become so deferential to a release strategy blatantly motivated by naked financial gain? The trend has grown apace since Tarantino's double Bill proved a financial godsend for Miramax, while audience resistance has dwindled to nothing. When the producers of the Harry Potter franchise split Deathly Hallows down the middle in 2010 (that's 3.5 horcruxes a film, stats fans) it still felt like a dicey manoeuvre. Three years later, a two-part conclusion is practically de rigueur, with The Hunger Games' final chapter Mockingjay set to double-team audiences across the autumns of 2014 and 2015 . Where fanboys and girls once felt hard done by such a mercenary approach to film distribution, now they actively petition studios to extend their tired franchises into oblivion . In some ways, the trend harks back to the age of cinema intermissions – short breaks in the middle of lengthy films designed to allow projectionists to change reels and audience members to stretch their legs and/or sneak into neighbouring screens. In 1969, a screening of Paint Your Wagon wasn't complete without the chance to stop halfway, have a breather and ponder whether or not Lee Marvin would manage to tame Jean Seberg's headstrong ways come the second act. The problem was that intermissions meant longer running times, which in turn meant fewer screenings per day. Why, the studios reasoned, should they give audiences three hours' entertainment for the price of one admission when they could hold half the narrative hostage for 12 months and double their money ? What we're left with is the movies' equivalent of those magazine subscriptions that promise you a die-cast Porsche but don't give you the tailpipe until week 79. The Hobbit's tailpipe will be shipped out next December, in the form of final franchise entry There And Back Again, but Tolkien obsessives need not despair. In an interview with MTV last year, director Peter Jackson (whose net worth was recently estimated at £220m) revealed that additional Middle-Earth movies would be a ""fine idea"". You know, for the fans."	Film
7871	7872	Bank of England expected to keep interest rates on hold 	"Interest rates are expected to remain on hold on Thursday as policymakers weigh up the mounting arguments for a first change in more than five years. This week's meeting of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) is the first since governor Mark Carney's warning in his annual Mansion House speech that rates could rise sooner than markets were expecting. Minutes from the last two meetings have shown that some members believe the arguments for raising rates have become more balanced as the UK economy recovers and the unemployment situation improves. Many economists predict the first rate hike will happen in November before gradual rises leave the rate in the region of 2.25% by the end of 2016. Rates have been at 0.5% since March 2009 and have not risen since 2007. This month's decision of the MPC will be announced at noon. The pound is at a near-six year high against the US dollar on forecasts of a rate rise later this year, although this momentum was jolted on Tuesday by unexpectedly weak output figures from the manufacturing sector. The Bank has also been given leeway by signs of more slack in the labour market than previously thought, following a fall in growth in average pay from 1.9% to 0.7%. Inflation has also been weaker than expected, at 1.5% in May. The expects growth of 0.9% in the second quarter, easing back to 0.7% in the third quarter following growth of 0.8% in the first three months of 2014. Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""We suspect that the vote to leave the Bank rate on hold will be unanimous once again. ""And while a rate hike before the end of the year cannot be ruled out if the recovery accelerates, the likely weakness of inflation means that there is a good chance the MPC sits on its hands until early 2015."""

12941	12942	Fifty Shades Of Grey: has sex in cinema become boring? 	 see the backed-up hunger for the forthcoming , with all its palely transgressive, kiss-the-lash sexual provocations, and I ask myself, did the clock just stop? Have we moved one inch into the sexual future since 1975? Is this still all it takes – a virginal naif willing to submit, a power magnate keen to dominate more than just his supine boardroom and stunted workforce, and a fancy set of bedroom restraints – to whip America up into a tumescent frenzy of anticipation? I say 1975 advisedly because that seems like the year when Hollywood topped out on what it was prepared to show sexually in the wake of the 1968 MPAA ratings reforms. Even now, even with the NC-17 rating, Hollywood is hard-pressed to match what was sexually acceptable in mid-70s international cinema. In movies like The Damned, The Night Porter and Salon Kitty, it was the Nazis who were the big pervy freaks – cross-dressing, engaging in polymorphous perversity at the drop of a spiked helmet, and offering severed heads in pretty boxes as fond love tokens. Now it’s the lions of Silicon Valley and other slavery-friendly carnivores of the One Per Cent whose libidos only come alive at the prospect of antiseptic steel-and-glass, power-game non-sex, with no touching and no eye-contact. It’s always businessmen, isn’t it, always these buccaneering capitalist overdogs? Christian Grey, whose big chopper really is just a helicopter, Mickey Rourke’s arbitrageur in 9 ½ Weeks, Richard Gere’s corporate raider in Pretty Woman, Patrick Bateman… Does that make their womenfolk metaphors for America, ready to bend themselves into any position to seek Wall Street’s perfidious and fleeting favour? Sexual melodramas are in a double bind today – the Golden Age of Hollywood is dead, but the Golden Age of Masturbation is in full flood. You can find more transgressive and troublingly icky sex on the internet before breakfast than will pass before the MPAA ratings board in the next century (they’re even getting to “fifth base” on The Mindy Project, meaning nowadays the most offensive thing about the butter sequence in Last Tango In Paris is the saturated fats). And it’s free for all, so how does Hollywood compete? Well, it doesn’t; instead, it gives us status porn: limos, helipads, penthouse sex-eyries, gazillion thread-count percale sheets. But never the wet spot in the bed, never the broken condom. In an age of sexual oversupply, I sometimes think fondly of “when they kept their clothes on”. Dorothy Malone removing her spectacles in , Marilyn’s diaphanous dress in Some Like it Hot, Cyd Charisse whipping off her floor-length green greatcoat to reveal that provocative red dress in The Band Wagon. For now I’ll count less as much, much more.	Film
5930	5931	Construction sector optimism fades as housing market cools 	Britain’s builders enjoyed their strongest run in 17 years in the third quarter but there are signs that growth will slow as . The construction sector has grown consistently for the past year and a half, but optimism among companies plummeted in September on outlook fears. The Markit/Cips construction PMI, a closely watched early indicator of activity, averaged at 63.5 between July and September – the strongest quarterly performance since the second quarter of 1997, when the survey began. A reading above 50 indicates growth. In September, the pace of growth in the sector continued to accelerate, with the index hitting an eight-month high of 64.2, up from 64 in August. It was better than the 63.5 forecast by City economists, and painted . Chris Williamson, chief Markit economist, said the data provided “more encouraging news on the health of the UK economy”. He added: “Although [construction] only represents around 6-7% of GDP, the sheer pace of expansion signalled by the PMI suggests that the construction sector can provide a meaningful boost to economic growth in the third quarter.” All elements of the sector showed strong growth last month: housebuilding continued to grow at the fastest pace, followed by commercial property construction and civil engineering. Despite the growth, the PMI showed signs that the strongest rates of expansion could be behind us. The pace of growth in housebuilding has slowed for the past two months and optimism among builders is fading, with the “business expectations” measure of the PMI falling to an 11-month low. The construction PMI follows a string of data in recent days that suggests the heat is coming out of the housing market. on Nationwide’s measure fell for the first time in 17 months in September, down 0.2% at £188,374. Nationwide’s figures came 24 hours after Bank of England data showed that mortgage lending had slipped for the second successive month in August. Williamson said: “Construction firms’ optimism in relation to the outlook fell to the lowest for nearly a year in September, sullied by concerns over a slowing housing market, shortages of both skilled labour and suitable subcontractors, higher interest rates and a general weakening of growth in the wider economy.” He said the could be the peak. The first official estimate of growth in the third quarter will be published by the Office for National Statistics on 24 October. Rob Wood, economist at the German bank Berenberg, also expected a weaker spell for the economy. He said: “While there is nothing to really worry about yet, we are cautious about growth over the next six months. Eurozone growth has disappointed, geopolitical risks have risen this year, the forthcoming general election creates domestic political risks, and the majority of the public expect rate hikes within the next 12 months. All of those could cause UK growth to ease a little in the near term.”	Business
11472	11473	David Cameron calls for united front from coalition 	" has called on the coalition to provide a ""strong, decisive and united government"" in the wake of acrimonious splits over Lords reform, warning that the public will not stand for ""division and navel-gazing"" at a time of social and economic insecurity. Writing in the , the prime minister acknowledged there were ""profound areas of disagreement"" between the Liberal Democrats and members of the Conservative party, 91 of whom rebelled last week against a reform package for the upper house championed by Nick Clegg. But he said MPs should remind themselves that such disagreements could not be allowed to stop the coalition working together. ""Of course the two parties have their differences and (in common with all recent governments) we have so far failed to resolve the issue of House of Lords reform,"" wrote Cameron. ""What's far more significant is that we are working together on so much else – and after last week, it's vital that everyone reminds themselves of that fact."" He added: ""These differences matter and at the next election they will help define us. But we're not in an election, now. We're not even close. People see riots and financial instability across Europe on the television news. They will tolerate tough choices if they see that you stand up for the right things together. But they will not tolerate division and navel-gazing. ""They know that the problems are big and they do not want to see politicians fall out in the process of dealing with them. That is why we must rise to the challenge, recognise the extraordinary and challenging nature of the times we live in – and serve the national interest by delivering a strong, decisive and united government."" Despite Cameron's appeal for unity, there remains pressure from the Tory backbenches for the PM to take a tougher line on his junior coalition partners. Liam Fox, the former defence secretary who resigned in October over links with his friend Adam Werritty, has the Liberal Democrats as a ""particular problem"" for the Conservatives. ""It's not sensible for people to make threats,"" he told the Sunday Telegraph. ""They have to remember they are a sixth of the coalition, not half the coalition."" He added: ""I think a lot of still deeply resent the fact we didn't win the general election and there is always a price for not winning. The price is that we have to live within a coalition and it's not a forced marriage, but it's a marriage of convenience."" Fox, a vociferous Eurosceptic, said Britain should try to renegotiate its position in Europe, saying its goal should be ""as loose a union as we can possibly get"". In a sign that Cameron is willing to give ground to Tory MPs who want to see their leader wield more clout in the coalition, the PM highlighted some of the areas where he differs markedly from the . He wrote: ""On Europe, for instance, we British need a fresh settlement – and a fresh mandate. Work on that can begin now but it is an issue to deal with in the next parliament, under a majority Conservative government. I take a profoundly different view from most Liberal Democrats on the European convention on human rights, too. I want to do whatever it takes to keep our country safe, restoring the ability to deport dangerous criminals and terrorists even if it means radical action in this area. And as I set out in a speech on welfare the other day, the next Conservative government must do more to end the benefits culture."""	Politics
11691	11692	England 1-3 Italy 	It has become a horribly familiar pattern: domination in qualifying, expectation in the build up and elimination at the finals. For the third time in succession England bowed out of the European Under-21 Championships at the group stage after slumping to a hugely-disappointing defeat to in Olomouc. Gareth Southgate had hoped his side’s in their second group game would liberate his players but here they were clinically dispatched by opponents who they have now failed to beat in five meetings at this tournament. In truth, the result was never in doubt after Andrea Belotti and Marco Benassi had put Italy two goals to the good in the space of two minutes midway through the first half. Benassi’s second with just under 20 minutes to go simply killed the potential for drama despite Nathan Redmond’s late consolation. Positive thinking had been prevalent in the camp throughout but this result left little scope for optimism. “We can’t put this group of young players in with everything else that has happened in England’s football history,” said Southgate. “These are young players and there’s some improvement that needs to happen in terms of their general defending as a group and as individuals. That’s the age they’re at. All teams in this competition have made defensive errors, sometimes they’re punished, sometimes they’re not. We’ve been punished ruthlessly for them.” Sweden’s 89th-minute equaliser against Portugal in the other Group B game meant that both sides here are heading home before the semi-finals. But while Italy went out on a high, this was certainly the lowest point of Southgate’s two-year tenure with the under-21s. The former Middlesbrough manager signed an extension to his contract with the Football Association in January and is scheduled to take the team through to the end of the 2017 edition of this competition. “I’m contracted to stay on, I’d like to stay on. In the end, it’s not my decision,” he said. “But I think what we’ve done over two years has progressed the profile of the team, the style in which we’ve played. I think we’ve had some massive success stories in terms of individuals that have come through the programme. Even in this tournament one or two players that have come through have emerged from it. So I think people will look at all of that when they’re making that decision.” Southgate had been bold with his team selection, playing Danny Ings in the No10 role behind Harry Kane and giving Brighton’s Jake Forster-Caskey a surprise first appearance of the tournament. He was rewarded with the brightest opening his side has made in the competition, with Ings pulling a shot wide when clean through and Kane, a cut above his team-mates here after enduring a largely frustrating tournament, drawing a spectacular save from Francesco Bardi in the Italy goal. Two minutes after that effort, though, events began to unravel for Southgate and his side. With England caught cold from an Italian free-kick, the impressive Domenico Berardi dinked the ball over the defensive line to find Belotti, whose telescopic volley beat Jack Butland from close range. Almost immediately the Azzurrini doubled the lead, with Lorenzo Crisetig allowed to rumble forward unchallenged and Benassi seeing his deflected shot curl low past the helpless goalkeeper. That left England with a huge task and though they set about it with relish, Italy drew the sting expertly. Even so Redmond, enjoying perhaps his best game of the tournament, Kane, Jesse Lingard and Ings all went close but any lingering hope was extinguished with 18 minutes to go. Stefano Sabelli took a throw-in, Marcello Trotta – probably best known in England for a promotion-costing penalty miss while on loan on Brentford in 2013 – hooked the ball over his head and Benassi directed his header past Butland, condemning England to yet another early exit. Redmond did eventually thrash home a goal that England’s energy deserved from the edge of the area in injury time but for Italy there were two more important late goals in the other group game between Sweden and Portugal. The first, for the Portuguese, looked to be sending them into the semi-finals. The second, an equaliser from Sweden’s Simon Tibbling, meant neither side in Olomouc will be playing in the final four. “There’s so little between the teams in this tournament,” said Southgate. “Sweden have gone through, Italy haven’t. There’s nothing between the eight teams in my opinion. So it then comes down to detail and concentration and the two-minute spell in the first half when we concede two is the turning point of the game.” It meant a bleak scene for all concerned at the Andruv Stadium – even the Czech fans in the crowd went home disappointed, with England’s defeat costing their side an Olympic play-off – but Southgate tried to sound a note of positivity. “In general terms, in terms of what they can give to English football, I think there are some good characters that are going to come through this group who will go into the senior team and make that senior team stronger.”	Football
14956	14957	Raheem Sterling to ask for Liverpool exit with Manchester City on alert 	 is expected to inform Liverpool this week that he wishes to leave the club, with Manchester City ready to test Anfield’s resolve that the England international will not be sold. The 20-year-old has put City – and other clubs – on alert that he will agitate for a move from after requesting fresh talks on his future with Anfield officials before the end of the Premier League season on Sunday. He had previously informed Brendan Rodgers that negotiations over a new contract would be postponed until the end of the season in order to concentrate solely on his football. However, the forward and his representative, Aidy Ward, are expected to tell Liverpool’s manager and the chief executive, Ian Ayre, on Friday that he will not sign a new deal with the club and wishes to move on. Sterling is said to be unhappy both at negative headlines surrounding his contract dispute with Liverpool and the absence of Champions League football at Anfield next season following the team’s miserable end to this one. Rodgers’ team have collected only eight points from the last 24 available to miss out on a top-four finish and were also eliminated from the FA Cup after a woeful display against Aston Villa in the semi-final. Liverpool could argue that Sterling’s form has dipped markedly since controversy erupted over his rejection of a new five-year contract worth £100,000-a-week and that it was his interview with the BBC, in which he denied being a “money-grabber” and said his ambition was to win trophies at the highest level, that generated the adverse publicity. Sterling, who has been linked with City and Arsenal in recent months, has already indicated to Rodgers that he wants to leave Liverpool and the latest round of talks could clarify his determination to see out his current contract, which has two years to run, should the club refuse to consider offers this summer. “The story has been blown somewhat out of proportion. Raheem and his representatives have a meeting scheduled with Liverpool later this week, and we will take proceedings from there.” Liverpool have been in discussions over a new deal since October but remain at deadlock over an agreement and their failure to secure a top-four finish represents a major setback to their hopes of convincing Sterling to stay. Liverpool do have him on a £35,000-a-week contract until 2017 and Rodgers has made it clear that he and the club’s owner, Fenway Sports Group, are minded not to sell even in the event of the impasse continuing beyond this summer. The Liverpool manager said recently: “Raheem won’t be going anywhere this summer, even if there’s not a deal agreed.” That stance has not altered since Sterling’s agent requested fresh talks ahead of the season’s finale at Stoke City on Sunday. Rodgers and FSG, however, are likely to receive confirmation in the coming days that Sterling has no intention of committing his future to Liverpool and City, who are keen to recruit young British talent this summer, will be favourites to capitalise on the continued deterioration in relations. A bid in excess of £30m may prompt Liverpool to reconsider their position on a player who should he leave in 2017 would attract only a compensation fee having been at Anfield since the age of 15. Only last week Steven Gerrard appealed to Sterling to sign a new contract. The departing captain said: “He should sign a new deal here. Brendan is a fantastic man-manager and puts a lot of time and effort into the development of an individual. The danger for these young players is they want it all too soon and they go chasing it. Then they go to another club and just become a number.” But Gerrard’s request appears almost certain to be ignored.	Football

He was eventually replaced in the 31st minute after slumping to the ground with suspected concussion. Germany went on to beat Argentina 1-0 in extra time to lift the trophy. Kramer’s continuation in the game, after suffering an apparent concussion, , as there were worrying head injuries for several other players earlier in the tournament. The Argentina players Javier Mascherano and Pablo Zabaleta also played on in their team’s after hard knocks to the head. The Uruguay defender Álvaro Pereira refused to leave the field after being hit in the head during the group stage. The incidents have led to debate over whether Fifa should allow a temporary substitution so a player can have a head injury properly checked.	Football
7499	7500	Caroline Flint tipped to run as Labour's deputy leader against Tom Watson 	 is extremely likely to run as deputy leader of the Labour party in a challenge to the likely trade union favourite Tom Watson, the Guardian understands. Flint, who was shadow energy secretary under Ed Miliband, will probably not declare until the timetable for the process is set out after a national executive committee meeting on Tuesday. However, sources close to the Yorkshire MP said she was almost certain to throw her hat into the ring. Watson is the only candidate for deputy at the moment and launched a crowdfunding attempt on Sunday to . The race to be deputy looks set to be an even starker clash between the Brownites and Blairites within the party than the race for the leadership. Watson, who campaigned against phone hacking, is deeply involved in the trade union movement and the old wing of the party. In contrast, Flint’s politics are closer to those of Blairites Chuka Umunna and Liz Kendall than those of the other potential leadership candidates Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham. Gloria De Piero, Miliband’s shadow equalities minister and a former GMTV presenter, is also a strong contender to be deputy leader, possibly on a ticket with Tristram Hunt as leader. Another possible choice for the deputy leadership is Angela Eagle, who was shadow leader of the House of Commons and delivered impressive performances in parliament against her Tory adversary, William Hague. The slate of potential deputies will be crucial to those running for leader as they seek to shape the future of the party in the aftermath of a crushing defeat at the hands of David Cameron. There may be some pressure in the Labour party to choose a woman as the next leader, but having strong female deputy leadership candidates could address this. Flint was often sent out to promote Labour’s campaign in the media, especially after the television debates, and trebled her majority in Don Valley at the election. It is understood she feels Labour needs to win back working- and middle-class voters in the south of England but wants the party to take time to reflect on what went wrong.	Politics

It will be the first time Green has appeared since and since t used to help customers evade tax. Green was chief executive and then chairman of HSBC from 2003 to 2010, the period covered by the leak of customer data about the banking arm, showing how it turned a blind eye to illegal activities of arms dealers and helped wealthy people evade taxes. The so-called files, which cover the period 2005-2007, amounted to the biggest banking data leak in history, shedding light on around 30,000 accounts holding almost $120bn (£78bn) in assets. The economic affairs committee, chaired by Clive Hollick, a Labour peer who used to run United Business Media, intends to ask Green about the Swiss operation and HSBC’s Mexican business, which was hit by . Imposing the fine, US regulators pointed to a “blatant failure” to implement anti-money-laundering controls in the bank’s Mexican operation that allowed local drug traffickers to deposit hundreds of thousands of dollars each day in HSBC accounts. Hollick’s committee will also ask whether global banks are too large to manage and whether the policy of US prosecutors to issue multimillion-pound fines against companies, rather than prosecute individuals, is the right approach to improve the ethics and culture of banks. Green will give evidence alongside Sir Win Bischoff, the veteran banker who is a former chairman of Lloyds Group. Bischoff is currently chairman of the Financial Reporting Council. Green and Bischoff will also be asked about the bonus culture in the City of London.	Business

Having paid out $3bn to music rights holders so far, is pitching itself as a competitor to traditional broadcasting, having recently added news, weather, podcasts and videos to its service. “The old-world paradigms we used to have are no longer true. When I think about music in the future, I don’t make a distinction between what’s radio, what used to be the music library, and so on,” Ek told the in a rare interview. “It’s only going to be listening – and, as that goes forward, this old notion of these different industries or different competitors will collapse and merge together.” Spotify is stepping up its efforts to appeal to mainstream radio listeners by emphasising its collection of playlists “programmed” by an in-house editorial team and suggested to users based on the time of day, popular activities and their listening habits. “We’re getting better and better at giving upcoming artists exposure on the service and creating tools to give those new artists a way to market themselves. In the future, people will listen to more music from a bigger variety of artists,” said Ek. “And if we build the revenue model around ‘freemium’ [a business model that gives basic products away for free], the music industry will be much larger than it’s ever been before, more artists will be able to make a living by being artists and more people will listen in turn.” Spotify will have to win over its doubters first, including convincing them that it can turn more of its 45 million free users into paying subscribers – it has 15 million of the latter – and thus increase the money earned by artists and songwriters, via its payouts to the labels and publishers that represent them. Some artists, most famously , have been criticising Spotify’s “freemium” approach, which allows people to listen for free to its basic, advertising-supported service. The boss of the world’s largest music label, Universal Music, called free streaming “not something that is particularly sustainable in the long term”. With industry rumours of Apple egging major labels on to restrict Spotify’s free service, Spotify is feeling the heat. “It’s no secret there’s been a lot of debate,” said Ek. “In any industry which is in a massive transition, those kinds of debates occur, so I don’t think it’s surprising. And suppliers always want to get paid more, which is also not very surprising.” Ek added that Spotify is “aligned with the industry” on its desire for more subscribers, but returned to the idea of Spotify as the new radio – traditionally a free, ad-supported medium – to stand his ground. “The entire recorded music industry has somewhere between $14bn and $15bn in trade-sales value. Now look at the radio industry, which in the US alone is around $16bn in revenue and globally is about $80bn – four times the size of the music industry,” said Ek. “If we’re able to transition the traditional radio behaviour online, you’re looking at a music industry that’s much larger than it’s ever been. If you do that, and also add subscription to the mix, especially at Spotify’s conversion rate, you’d be looking at a music industry that would be $100bn to $160bn in size. That’s the key argument that I think gets lost here.” Spotify is far from the only company pursuing this aim. Deezer, Rhapsody, Tidal, SoundCloud and other streaming services are jockeying for attention, although it is technology giants Apple and Google that are more likely to be Spotify’s nemeses. On Monday, Apple is expected to unveil its new rival to Spotify, with hundreds of millions of iPhone and iPad users to market to, and deep pockets to secure exclusive music from popular musicians. Google has one service already live under its Google Play brand, and another in testing. Ek claimed that Spotify’s music focus will be its trump card. “We don’t really do anything else other than selling music, so we’re the most aligned with the music industry,” he said. “We don’t have the search box that we’re making money from, or the hardware that we’re making money from.” The downside to this is resources: Spotify reported revenues of €1bn in 2014, compared with Apple’s $199.7bn and Google’s $66bn. The costs of running a streaming music service – Spotify reported a loss of €165m in 2014 – are a drop in the ocean for hardware and search-engine businesses. “Yes, obviously it’s easier if they want to absorb the costs into other places. But we believe in the business model of Spotify, and believe that ultimately we’ll become profitable at some point,” said Ek. “If we think there’s 10x potential yet to be unlocked, why wouldn’t we invest in that growth rather than optimise for short-term profitability? We think this is a huge opportunity.”	Technology
6405	6406	Jack Reacher film gives New Zealand viewer too little bang for his buck 	"A seen in a trailer for recent Tom Cruise thriller did not make the final cut is to get his money back. The man, identified only as J Congdon, complained to New Zealand's Advertising Standards Authority after realising the tantalising shot had been removed from the theatrical release by Hollywood studio Paramount. ""The explosion where the whole cliff comes down was the defining part of the ad that made me really want to go see the movie … aside from having in it,"" he wrote in his letter of complaint. Paramount said it was happy to refund the cost of a ticket but pointed out that it was standard practice for Hollywood to release trailers cut ""weeks or months"" in advance of the final movie. ""Thus, despite our best intentions, it is always possible that certain scenes appearing in an advertisement or trailer may not appear in the final version of a film,"" the studio told the authority. ""The explosion in question was a single split-second element omitted from a 130-minute long action film."" The studio said at least two other shots in the trailer had not made the final cut. New Zealand's Commercial Approvals Bureau, which approved the trailer, said it believed the complaint should be dismissed because the promo posed ""no threat of confusion to the large majority of TV viewers"". The Advertising Standards Authority ruled the matter settled because a ticket refund had been offered and the offending advertisement was no longer airing."	Film
2057	2058	Divergent review – lacks lustre and grit 	A somewhat lacklustre contender for the throne, this latest slice of dystopian young-adult entertainment is based on a runaway bestseller penned by while still an undergraduate. The hokey setup finds a futuristic, postwar society in which the now pacified population are divided into five distinct groups, each with their own singular attributes: Abnegation (selfless); Amity (peaceful); Candor (honest); Dauntless (brave); and Erudite (intelligent). No, I didn't buy it either, but never mind because neither does heroine Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) who commits the unspeakable crime of having more than one skill, thus making her… Divergent! Rising star Woodley (who picked up a Golden Globe nomination playing George Clooney's daughter in ) gives it some welly in the lead role, more than holding her own again Kate Winslet's sinister uber-matriarch Jeanine, but Tris is no Katniss Everdeen, at least not yet – inevitably, this is the first instalment in a trilogy, with and to follow. Drab production design (bombed-out buildings and costumes) aims for gloomy portent, but the grit feels as fake as the fashionable tattoos.	Film
14934	14935	Petr Cech will decide on his Chelsea future in the summer 	Petr Cech has no intention of remaining as Chelsea’s second-choice goalkeeper and will make a decision on his future this summer. After a decade as Chelsea’s first-choice goalkeeper, the 32-year-old Czech Republic international has been displaced as No1 by Thibaut Courtois this season. Cech has made four Premier League starts to Courtois’ 25 this term, but did play in the earlier this month in what could be interpreted as a show of thanks from manager José Mourinho. “I don’t know what the club’s idea will be,” Cech told the website of Czech newspaper Idnes. “It looks like it works well with me and Thibaut as a duo. But that can work for one season only. I don’t want another one like this. “There always will be speculation. I leave it for the summer. It will be important to sit down with the club and with the manager to consider all the pros and cons. We will see what will work out the best.” Cech has been linked with clubs such as Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Arsenal. Mourinho earlier this month insisted he would not stand in Cech’s way should he wish to leave at the end of the season. But Cech’s status means a big fee will be required to prise him from Stamford Bridge as his contract does not expire until the end of next season. “I don’t waste my time trying to persuade him, because I know nobody can persuade him,” Mourinho said. “If he tells me he wants to leave, I will tell him my opinion and my opinion is one of the three best goalkeepers in the world. Huge money.”	Football

13022	13023	Emma Brockes meets Clint Eastwood, one of the last American heroes, to talk about films, politics and ageing 	"eople who have worked with invariably talk about the first time he rang and the effect of his creaky, whispery voice on their nervous system. In a studio on the Warner Brothers lot in Burbank, California, his arrival is counted down in paces between the coffee urn and the biscuit tray, while outside people queue for a chatshow next door and executives glide to lunch in their golf buggies. Eastwood enters with an awkward, loping gait, as from another era. He has made films of every stripe in the past 10 years, but for most of us he will always be that man: who starts a fight in a saloon, who defends a lady's honour, who, now that Paul Newman is gone, is one of the last American heroes. Or, as he puts it with conscientious self-mockery and a flash of his green, green eyes, ""the jerk from the plains"". Longevity in Hollywood can inspire embarrassing devotion and Eastwood, heading towards 80, finds much of what comes his way unseemly. Men have a hard time comporting themselves in his presence; women make regrettable observations about his green eyes. The myth is so established, one forgets that in the 60s and early 70s, he made a lot of schlocky, forgettable westerns as well as classics such as The Good, The Bad And The Ugly. The cowboy, marshal or gunslinger whose idea of showing emotion is to shift a cigar from one side of his mouth to the other is a heroic type we are supposed to have outgrown. And yet the glamour persists, entwined as it is with ideas of what it is to be American and a nostalgia, perhaps, for less officious eras. Eastwood didn't say much in those films, but what he did say - ""You didn't hear the lady, did you, boy?"", ""Cool it, cowboy"", ""Next time I'll knock your damn head off"" - compacted over time into legend. Even the most banal line - ""Put your pants on, chief"" - was transformed by Eastwood's growl into something sounding like wisdom. Today he settles in his director's chair with the cool, polite detachment he reserves, one imagines, for outlaws and journalists. There are spots of high colour on his cheeks that make him look, oddly, rather vulnerable and take the menace out of his pointy incisors. Eastwood's tough-guy image was always leavened by something soft at the edges, the beauty spot above his lip, the fact that he was, throughout the 60s, very obviously a man who got as much use out of his hairdryer as Warren Beatty. He worked hard to break the mould of that early career in a way he now jokes about. Eastwood is about to cast for a film about Nelson Mandela, adapted from John Carlin's book, and when I ask who will play him, he looks devilish and says, ""I'm going to play him. I'm going to show you my versatility."" (It will actually be Morgan Freeman. ""Perfect casting for Mandela."") One way or another, Eastwood's interests always seem to come back to the issue of heroism, particularly to the unsympathetic hero. In his new film, Gran Torino, he plays Walt Kowalski, a trigger-happy, cantankerous old bigot (imagine if Henry Fonda in On Golden Pond had been armed) who learns over time to love his Hmong neighbours more than his petulant family and to make a great sacrifice for them. It sounds corny, but it's a better film than Million Dollar Baby, the sentimental Oscar-winner he directed in 2004 and in which he played a similar role. Once Eastwood stops snarling and overacting - a pitfall of directing oneself - he turns in a touching performance and the film is funny and moving and unexpectedly shocking. Did he want to play Walt from the off? ""Yeah."" Yeah? ""Yeah."" Right. Eventually, he continues: ""Yeah, I liked the dilemmas he had to go through. I liked the message of antique America that is maybe obsolete. Walt may be obsolete."" He laughs gently. ""But he does learn new things. And that's what makes it interesting. You take a guy who's way out opinionated, insulting to equal opportunity"" - this sounds like a phrase he's had to adjust to - ""an insulter, and you put him with people where he's antagonistic as hell. And then all of a sudden he looks in the mirror and says, 'I have more in common with these people than my own spoilt, rotten family.' He's realising these folks like having him around, even though he's not particularly on the surface likable."" The film nervously calibrates Walt's bigotry by going overboard with examples of affectionate racial mockery between Irish, Italians and Poles to show that, you know, there are levels to these things. I ask whether he was anxious about getting this tone right. ""I wasn't anxious about anything. I figure one thing when you get to my age is, what can they do to ya?"" Likewise, he bats away being overlooked at the Oscars. Gran Torino was number one at the US box office but didn't get a single nomination. ""I have had three films nominated out of the last five I've made. I just make the film the best I can. The rest is political stuff and posturing. I'm not terribly good at that. I think our message was as good as any message out there this year. There we are."" At some point, the reticence of Dirty Harry and Joe Kidd turned into the old-age misanthropy of Walt Kowalski and Frankie Dunn, and when, in 2000, Eastwood made Space Cowboys with Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland, the joke was it should have been called Grumpy Old Astronauts. At 78, he is still wiry and tough looking, but his posture is bad and his famous whisper sounds, occasionally, like the frailty of age. ""Eighty is just a number,"" he says. ""A lot of people are old at 40."" No twinges of vanity when he sees himself on screen? ""It's too late for vanity. If I was 30, maybe, I'd say, 'Hey, that's not a good angle.' But there is no good angle now. So you just kinda accept it and go ahead."" Eastwood is kept young, perhaps, by his family; he has seven children who range in age from 12 to their early 40s. The 12-year-old daughter, Morgan, lives with him and his second wife, Dina Ruiz, a former TV anchorwoman from Arizona. He married his first wife, Maggie Johnson, when he was 21 and had two children with her. They didn't divorce for 30 years, during which time he had a child with Roxanne Tunis, two with Jacelyn Reeves and one with Frances Fisher, while conducting a long relationship with the actor Sondra Locke. I wonder if Morgan thinks he's cool or embarrassing. Eastwood looks surprised. ""I think she thinks I'm a cool dad. We get along very well. I have a teenage daughter as well. And I think they think I'm all right. I'm not totally objective. I don't think they think of me as a guy who should be their grandfather. I used to joke about it: that my kids didn't give me any grand- children, so I just had my own grandchildren."" One imagines that being the son of Clint Eastwood throws up very particular problems, as being the daughter of some icon of femininity might for a girl. I ask if his sons have had a tougher time of it than his daughters. ""Maybe. Maybe not. I don't think so."" He pauses. ""Maybe."" Another long pause. ""I don't think they need to get screwed up. The parents have to keep instilling in them the logic of life. Not everyone becomes a known figure. There's disadvantages to it and there's advantages to it. Don't try to make it any more than it is."" This isn't, of course, something he can entirely control, the way his fame affects his children. ""You're never in total control. But you have to have ambitions to set the agenda and fate does the rest."" Control is a big thing for Eastwood, whose ""logic of life"" is deeply entwined with his Libertarian politics, which he brings up with a wry smile, taking into account that most people think Libertarianism is at best unrealistic and at worst crackpot. He registered as a Republican in 1951 in support of Eisenhower, whom he admired for his second world war heroism and election promise to end the war in Korea. Eastwood's short tenure as mayor of Carmel, the town south of San Francisco where he lives, was premised, he told the New Yorker, on ""doing things for people who can't stand up for themselves"". Since then, he says, the Republican party has lost its way - he was not in favour of going to war in Iraq, and the evangelical side of the party annoys him. ""The only thing John McCain and I really agreed upon was that the Republicans had lost their way because they lost their philosophy."" The core of that philosophy, he says, is that ""people should be responsible for themselves and fiscal responsibility is very, very important."" He says of the current economic crisis: ""The great saying that if you don't pay attention to history you're doomed to repeat it is pretty much true. Pretty much true. Now we're repeating it. You get what you deserve."" For the election, his wife registered as an independent, although, he says, they both thought, ""Obama seemed like a nice guy."" And Eastwood? ""I registered,"" he smiles, ""Libertarian. I like the philosophies. The Libertarian party is nothing and they don't have any candidates. But I do believe if we just leave everybody alone, quit trying to think of ways to run everybody else's life, maybe we'd be better off. It may be impractical. It may be obsolete, that kind of thinking."" He looks off into the distance: ""It's just kinda the way I was raised."" Eastwood's long-term vision about his career was unusual both in its accuracy and the tenacity with which he pursued it. In his early 30s, he could see that if he carried on making westerns they would get worse and he would eventually fall out of fashion. The way to save himself was to diversify. He is a pianist and has written the scores for many of his films, but it was to directing that he turned. He had campaigned to direct episodes of Rawhide, the TV series that started his career; the studio refused, but finally, in 1971, he was given Play Misty For Me, a low-budget film about a woman stalking a local radio star. Misty is still a tense, well-managed thriller today, although there is a self-indulgent bit where the character played by Eastwood and his girlfriend frolic on a beach, in a wood and under a waterfall, that would presage overlong sequences in many of his films. Directing, he says, is the greater joy. ""You're the storyteller. As an actor you're just involved with the one component, your component. And your relationship to the ensemble. I prefer directing. I have to. I'm at the age where I should. So."" Eastwood is not a shouter on set; his is a quiet authority. Apart from Spike Lee, no one in the industry seems to have a bad word for him. He is said to be gentlemanly to a fault, professional, deeply engaged. He is also disinclined to censor himself. It is customary when making a film based on a novel not to bad-mouth the source material. In 1995 he made The Bridges Of Madison County, one of the directing roles that, with Unforgiven, raised his profile as a serious director; he called Robert James Waller's novel ""fancy, pretentious writing"" that he had ""fought"" to get through. His tiff with Spike Lee last year followed Lee's accusations that Eastwood did not include any black soldiers in his second world war film Flags Of Our Fathers, the story of the men who raised the US flag after the battle of Iwo Jima. It is a bleak, beautiful film that seems to go on for several days and, amid all the battle scenes, exploits what Eastwood has always done best: stillness. He replied that Lee should ""shut his face"" - the film was historically accurate. Now he says, ""It wasn't really a tiff. I was in Cannes and somebody said that he was quoted saying this and that. Some journalist. And I said, well if he said that... and I shot my mouth off. But he's a nice guy. I think Spike was just trying to promote his flick. I understand the game."" He grins. ""I just thought I wasn't going to let him off the hook."" He won't speculate on how he has influenced cinema, or who he considers to be the heirs to Dirty Harry or Josey Wales. Jason Bourne, perhaps, although he gets too weepy over his dead girlfriend. Eastwood never betrayed an interior life beyond the hint of a secret sadness. He never fell for the posse mentality, and even when he was playing a cop, he was as suspicious of the law as of the outlaws - in Hang 'Em High, a judge admonishes his Marshal Jedediah Cooper: ""You can be the best I've ever had, the best there is, if you remember this: you work for the government. You work for justice."" His characters didn't work for anyone, of course, which is why we'll always love them. For his own inspiration, he says, he looked to John Wayne and Gary Cooper, ""old-time movie actors. I was influenced by James Cagney a lot. I liked his inner vitality. And he was fearless. Not afraid to do crazy things, take a grapefruit in the face. I've always felt that suited me as well."" What is that, not being afraid to fail? ""I think it's just... not being afraid."" He quotes FDR - ""The only thing to fear is fear itself"" - then repeats it in a silly voice, to show he isn't that pompous. ""Anyway, it was like that mentality. Yeah, I'll just barge in, make that commitment, go for it, otherwise you miss great opportunities to enjoy yourself and have fun and create characters that are interesting. Sometimes you have to swing hard and miss the ball. But you have to swing hard."" Given his fame, Eastwood has an unusually sensible attitude. He hasn't burned out, or become an addict, or cast himself against women half his age. There's no great mystery to it, he says. ""Just stacking up information. Not forgetting it."" He drops his voice even lower than his usual whisper and leans in. ""Not forgetting."" His eyes really are very green. Gran Torino is released on Friday. This article was amended on Monday 23 February 2009. We originally said that Clint Eastwood plays a ""cantankerous old bigot ... who learns to love his Korean neighbours"". The neighbours are Hmong, not Korean. This has been corrected."	Film
9386	9387	BFI heralds billion-pound year for British film 	"The British Film Institute heralded a billion-pound UK film industry today, publishing figures that show that investment from overseas sources in film production in the UK rose by 14% to £1.075bn for 2013. The rise was spurred on by 37 major international productions basing themselves in the UK, with everything from forthcoming Marvel blockbuster to starry dramas like being at least partially made on these shores. Two of the most surefire hits of the coming years, in the next movie and , are also set to be made in the UK. It's a trend that the UK government is trying to promote via its to the rules regarding tax breaks for the film industry: films only need to now spend 10% of their budget within the UK to qualify for tax relief, where previously they had to spend 25%. George Osborne acknowledged as much, saying: ""These fast growing sectors are creating jobs across the country and each new job means security for another family. I want to build on this success and showcase the world class talent this country has, encouraging more films and TV programmes to be made here."" The latest tack is to woo China and its massive audiences, with struck recently that allows Sino-British productions to bypass the quota system in China that only allows a certain number of international films to be screened there. Homegrown productions were spending less money however, with just £139m spent on British-produced films costing over £500,000, compared with £229m in 2012. The courting of international productions comes as of British films were found to be profitable between 2003 and 2010, and independent UK films made up only 6% of the total UK box office last year. The Working Title-produced musical was named as the top grossing UK film at the UK box-office, with £41m. Those box office takings were over £1bn for the third year in a row, but actually faltered slightly, falling by 1% – but 2012 was buoyed by , the highest-grossing film ever in the UK. Animation continues to be a massive draw for UK audiences, with the highest-grossing film of 2013, and Frozen, Monsters University and The Croods all in the top 10; the top five also included The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, Les Miserables and Iron Man 3. The big independent UK films last year were topped by , which took £11m, followed by Quartet, I Give It a Year, and Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa."	Film
13258	13259	World Cup 2014: ‘Very cool’ Marouane Fellaini praised by Belgium players 	Belgium’s players have paid tribute to Marouane Fellaini for coming to their rescue in their opening World Cup match, suggesting that his national side know how to use him better than . Fellaini has endured a miserable time since moving to Old Trafford last summer in a £27.5m deal but equalised for Belgium in their just five minutes after coming off the bench in the second half. Jan Vertonghen, the Tottenham Hotspur defender who gave away the first-half penalty that handed Algeria the lead, said Fellaini was “very important” to the national side. “I know there has been a lot of pressure on him from the fans in England but in he always does well and scores goals,” said Vertonghen. “I’m very pleased for him and I gave him a little hug after the game because I know that goal meant a lot to him. “Marouane is a very cool guy. The pressure doesn’t really bother him too much. We know how to use him and I don’t know whether they do in his other team.” Belgium’s captain Vincent Kompany said Fellaini’s qualities had always been apparent in a national shirt. “Fellaini is a terrific player and any player in his first season at a new club, it can be tough. You have to grant players a couple of seasons before you can judge someone. For us, with Belgium, he has been doing it time and time again. Players like Dries Mertens as well are our weapons coming off the bench.” Fellaini, who was the only major incoming transfer at Old Trafford last summer but faces an uncertain future under United’s new manager Louis van Gaal, said that Belgium’s substitutes had made a “big impact” on the game. Marc Wilmots introduced Mertens, who scored the winner, at half-time and Fellaini 20 minutes into the second half. “Everyone knows we have good players, we have a good team, but for the first 30 minutes, we were just so nervous, there was too much stress. I think that is normal for the first together but in the second half we showed the character of Belgium and we played very well,” he said. “It was a great goal, it was great for me and for the team. It’s not been the best season for me but football is like this. It is a boost for the confidence of the Belgian team. Algeria made it so tough, but we showed our character and ability.” The highly fancied Belgians, who struggled in the first half against a well organised Algeria side, face Fabio Capello’s Russia in their second game on Sunday. Kompany admitted nerves played a part in their unconvincing first-half display against Algeria. “It was the very, very first minutes of any World Cup ever for this generation of Belgian players, all of the players except for Daniel Van Buyten have never been at a World Cup,” he said, admitting that the pressure to perform had an effect. “Of course for those first 15 minutes, however much experience you have in wider football – I remember even Lionel Messi saying how he had felt the pressure when he first played at a World Cup – so how is it possible for us not to feel it?” But he said he was proud of his teammates for not panicking when they went behind and for slowly working their way back into the game. “It means a lot that we overcame a difficult start but as much as it means, we remain calm for the rest of the campaign as well, we know it will be tough against Russia. The biggest mistake we can do is underestimate these teams. Hopefully we’ll do our job and we can qualify and like any team, grow in this tournament. “After 15 or 20 minutes we got control of the game and then conceded at that moment. We never panicked, we stayed calm. We actually had these kind of scenarios quite often in the qualifiers as well, so that helps.” Romelu Lukaku, who struggled in the first half and was withdrawn after an hour, said the team was not dynamic enough in the first period. “We played too slowly in possession in the first half, it was not dynamic enough but in the second half, it was much quicker, we got more crosses in the box and we scored from one,” said the Chelsea striker, who spent last season on loan at Everton. “It has been so long for us to wait to play at a World Cup and we have a young team as well so we had difficulties in the first hour of the game but then we took it into our hands like a big team should do.” Lukaku predicted Belgium would learn from the experience and improve as the tournament progressed. “We showed patience. Most of the players who started were playing for Belgium at 16, 17 or 18. We have shown we can be aggressive, we have shown that even though we are young, we have experience,” he said. “I think we can play well against anyone – it was good to win and now we can grow into the tournament.”	Football
11502	11503	Ukip, the Tory MP and her father: the candidate who temporarily wasn't 	"The Conservative party and Ukip have been involved in a plot worthy of The Thick of It after the father of the backbench Tory MP Priti Patel embarked on a double U-turn over his candidacy for Britain's new insurgent force. As Lord Tebbit provoked Downing Street by offering a carefully qualified endorsement of Ukip, the party leader, Nigel Farage, proudly announced that the father of one of the most prominent Thatcherite MPs would be standing in Hertfordshire in Thursday's local elections. Within a few hours of the announcement Conservative sources said that Patel, who shares his daughter's admiration for Thatcher, would not be standing for their rivals. Ukip then released a statement saying that Sushil Patel would after all be standing in the Bushey South ward in the Hertfordshire county council elections, but that he would not conduct any interviews as he recovers from an operation. It is understood that Patel Sr, who had been warned by the Tories that his candidacy would do his daughter no favours, decided to stay in the race after it was pointed out that candidates could only withdraw by noon 16 days before an election. In the statement he said: ""I am proud of being a Ukip candidate and very proud of the achievements of my daughter who represents the people of Witham in an exemplarily fashion. My views are my own and I am astonished that there has been quite so much interest in my candidacy."" Priti Patel : ""He's my dad and I love him."" The announcement that Sushil Patel – whose daughter says Thatcher inspired her to enter politics – is standing came as a welcome boost for Ukip which says it is casting itself as Britain's true Thatcherite party. Priti Patel first made her name working for the Referendum party of the late Jimmy Goldsmith. Farage said the candidacy of Patel Sr, who fled to Britain from Uganda in the 1960s to escape the dictatorship of Idi Amin, for Ukip showed that the party was not opposed to all immigration. He said: ""Mr Patel … came to Britain in 1972 when Amin was trying to kill all the Asians. It was a proposed genocide by Amin. We had a huge debate in Britain about could we accommodate the sheer numbers; could we cope with a refugee influx on that scale. We concluded that morally we had no choice but to give those people refuge, and 27,000 came. ""Could we open the doors to Poland and several other eastern European countries in 2004? In two years a million came. We are dealing with something now on a completely different scale. More people came here in 2010 than came here – excluding wartime – between 1066 and 1950. It really is a question of scale. Our strong feeling is that giving away control of who comes to live, work and settle in your country is a rather irresponsible and rather stupid thing to do."" The news that Sushil was Priti's father only reached the Ukip leadership on Monday. As Patel Sr filled out a form to win a place on the list of approved Ukip parliamentary candidates, he contacted his local chairman to say that the only person who could verify it was his daughter, a Conservative MP. It took some time for this useful nugget of information to reach Farage's aides. But once they knew, Farage trumpeted the news at the first high-profile campaign event. The party has faced a difficult few days amid press revelations that some candidates are former BNP members and at least one holds allegedly anti-Semitic views. One source said: ""Sushil Patel is an absolutely bloody decent chap."" The confusion over the Patel candidacy came as Tebbit accused the Tory leadership of launching a smear campaign against Ukip, and all but endorsed the party. Writing on his , the former Conservative chairman said he would be voting Tory in Suffolk for pragmatic reasons to ensure his council did not fall into Labour, Lib Dem of Green hands. But Tebbit added: ""Of course it may well be that many former Conservative voters are so fed up with the Cameron coalition that they will turn to Ukip as the party which comes closest to a traditional Conservative agenda, and a reasoned position on the European issue. One can hardly blame them for that."" Ukip could face an investigation by the broadcasting watchdog, Ofcom, over accusations it made misleading claims in its party election broadcast over Britain's contribution to the EU. The pro-European British Influence thinktank lodged a complaint after Ukip claimed that Britain was ""sending £53m a day to Brussels"". The thinktank says the figure is less than £19m a day. Its director, Peter Wilding, said: ""Ukip are spinning figures about the EU when the true cost is much smaller and balanced by benefits. We'd like to see a debate based on the facts and not spin and that's why we have written to Nigel Farage and made this complaint."" An Ofcom spokesman said: ""Ofcom can confirm that it has received a complaint regarding a party election broadcast by Ukip, which we are assessing but not currently investigating."" A Ukip candidate in Somerset who was suspended by the party after photos were published of him apparently making a Nazi salute said the allegations were completely untrue. Alex Wood, 22, claimed that he was simply reaching out for a friend's mobile phone during a Halloween party where he was dressed as a pirate. Wood told the BBC: ""The supposed salute was my left hand reaching for my friend's mobile. My Facebook account has been hacked. This matter is being dealt with by the police. I see myself as a democratic libertarian. Racist, homophobic, fascist views absolutely disgust me. So these statements are not mine."""	Politics

The deal could become the biggest to be wrecked by the White House’s clampdown on tax inversions. Shares in Shire, best known for its hyperactivity drugs although it now focuses on rare diseases, crashed 28%, or £14.40, to £36.90, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 index. in AstraZeneca, also a takeover target, fell 4.1% while hips-and-knees maker Smith & Nephew slid 3.1%. AbbVie said its board would meet next Monday to reconsider the to vote for the merger agreement, which would create one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. The Chicago-based firm had planned to shift its tax base from the US to Britain as part of the deal to cut its corporation tax rate from 22% to 13% by 2016. Last month US Treasury officials unveiled new rules to make it harder for American companies to complete tax inversion deals. The measures bar companies from using cash held overseas to fund such takeovers. reignited the debate over inversions, which Barack Obama has denounced as unpatriotic. Referring to the new tax rules, AbbVie said it would discuss the “impact to the fundamental financial benefits of the transaction” and consider whether to withdraw or modify its recommendation. Some analysts speculated whether the takeover could be renegotiated, while others think it is dead in the water. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said: “The likelihood of the AbbVie/Shire deal has all but disappeared judging by the market reaction, whilst the possibility of Pfizer approaching AstraZeneca anew must also be in serious jeopardy, both falling foul of the potential tightening of US tax inversion laws.” AbbVie will have to pay a hefty break fee of $1.6bn to Shire if it decides to walk away from the deal. US hedge funds including Paulson & Co and Elliott Capital, which have been buying up Shire’s shares, will be among the losers if the takeover collapses. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: “Shareholders in Shire must be doing a double-take this morning with shares back trading at mid-June levels. It still stands to pick up a handsome $1.6bn in deal break fees. “However, that’s far from compensation for the £10bn market cap gains (40% share price rise), which many considered to be in the bag with the deal set to close in the fourth quarter.” Shire said it was notified overnight by AbbVie of its plans, but said the US company had not quantified the anticipated financial impact of the clampdown on tax inversions. “The board of Shire believes that AbbVie should proceed with the recommended offer on the agreed terms in accordance with the cooperation agreement,” the UK company said. Its board will meet to discuss the situation. in retention payments if the deal went ahead. Savvas Neophytou at Panmure Gordon still expects the deal to go through. He notes the anti-inversion changes will require Senate support and “this is far from being a certainty and will likely take considerable time”. Ana Nicholls, healthcare analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said that tax savings aside, there are other benefits to the deal. AbbVie faces patent expiry on its main product, Humira for rheumatoid arthritis, the world’s top-selling medicine. Shire has a strong lineup of hyperactivity drugs, along with a promising portfolio of drugs for rare diseases. “This is only a rethink, in short, and AbbVie’s board may instead recommend a modification of the deal – which could mean trying to renegotiate the price or change other terms of the deal,” Nicholls said. Other US companies looking to redomicile abroad to make huge tax savings include Pfizer, whose . The Viagra maker could come back with a new bid late next month after a six-month cooling-off period expires. Two days ago, Ohio-based for $1.9bn in a deal that would shift its tax domicile to the UK, cutting its tax rate from 31% to 25%. It is the second planned inversion deal announced since the Obama administration tightened its rules. The top federal corporate tax rate in the US is 35% while the average in Europe is 20%, according to Douglas S Shire is scheduled to publish third-quarter results next Friday. Following record quarterly revenues in the second quarter, trading has remained strong, it said.	Business
11390	11391	David Cameron: blame education not migration for factories' foreign labour 	"Eastern European immigrants should not be blamed for seeking jobs in UK factories when not enough young people in Britain are fully capable of doing the same jobs, has said. The prime minister said half the workforce in some factories came from Poland, Lithuania or Latvia, as people from those countries wanted to work and were well qualified. During a trip to a Mini plant in Oxford on Monday, he said Britain's response should be to improve the education system ""so we are producing young people out of our schools and colleges who are fully capable of doing those jobs"". ""You can go to factories in our country where half the people come from Poland, Lithuania or Latvia,"" Cameron said. ""You can't blame them – they want to work, they see the jobs, they come over and they do them. ""But as a country what we ought to be saying is: 'No, let's get our education system right so we are producing young people out of our schools and colleges who are fully capable of doing those jobs.'"" He said the key was linking education, welfare reform and immigration, but there was a risk that some under-qualified young people would be left behind in the recovery. ""Crack those three problems together and we can really get an economy that generates wealth for our people,"" he said. ""The danger for a country like Britain is, yes, you see the economy recover, yes, you see jobs coming, but you leave behind people who have not got the right qualifications from school. I don't want that to happen in our country."""	Politics

If all you need is to browse the web and do some simple word processing then a is ideal, but it will not run applications like iTunes or Word, instead relying on Microsoft Office-compatible Google Docs and other web apps. The Chromebook 11 is the best Chromebook available, with a solid build quality, excellent full-size keyboard and trackpad.

1263	1264	Warsi hits back at Osborne: 'George is a good friend of the Israeli government' 	"Sayeeda Warsi has attacked for failing to raise enough concerns with Israel about its bombing of Gaza, and urged other ministers who are privately expressing concern about the crisis to speak out. The senior Conservative directed her ire at the chancellor after he said her resignation over the government's position on Gaza was ""disappointing and frankly unnecessary"". Speaking to Channel 4 News, Warsi also revealed there is concern ""at ministerial level"" about the government's failure to condemn Israel's shelling of civilians in Gaza as disproportionate. One minister has talked about resigning and another senior Conservative backbencher has been in tears on the phone about it, she said. Asked about Osborne's comments, she said: ""George is a very good friend of the Israeli government and therefore he, more than anybody else, should have been saying quite frankly to the Israeli government that what you are doing is not in your interest. This is probably the biggest single act of self-harm that the Israeli government has done over the last few years. What he should have been saying to the Israeli government is that it is unnecessary for you to kill innocent civilians, to displace a quarter of the Gazan population, for you to flatten schools, hospitals and power supplies and water supplies to achieve your end. Had George done that, I agree with him that it would not have been necessary for me to resign."" She added: ""I think it's a sincerely held view that the best way to resolve this matter is to be as accommodating as possible to the Israeli government, to seek influence with them and through that to try and move them to a more positive decision. I'm not sure that policy is working."" Warsi also lifted the lid on unhappiness within the ranks of the Conservative party about the response to the conflict, which has now been going on for a month. ""Without dropping people in it I can say there is unease on the backbenches, there is concern at ministerial level,"" she said. ""I have had one senior Conservative on the phone in tears about material that they had seen and the fact they felt we weren't doing anything about it. I've had a minister in a late night conversation talking about resignation. There is real concern among Conservatives about this issue. I hope if there is some good that comes out of it people who feel the same way as I do are prepared to raise these voices within government and are taken seriously."" One of the peer's major points of concern has been David Cameron's refusal to say that Israeli action in Gaza has been ""disproportionate"" like he did when the country launched an incursion into Lebanon in 2006. While the prime minister has said the UN was right to condemn a bombing near a third school, he has otherwise only called for an immediate ceasefire, while taking care to blame Hamas for sparking the conflict. ""I think for me it's morally indefensible where after four weeks of a conflict more than a quarter of the Gazan population displaced, more than 2,000 people killed, more than 400 innocent children killed, we still cannot find the words to say, we condemn this and we feel this action has been disproportionate. These issues are too serious for us to be mealy-mouthed and for us to be dragging our heels."" Warsi gave the interview after earlier releasing her resignation letter to the prime minister, which spoke of her concerns that the fall-out from the Gaza crisis could lead to radicalisation of young Muslims. ""There is no doubt there is the potential for radicalisation for young people,"" she said. ""I fundamentally believe the way in which we conduct ourselves domestically does impact on our reputation internationally, and the way we behave internationally does have blow-back domestically … It's not a claim I make there is evidence there in black and white in the work that the Home Office is doing. These reports and this evidence makes for uncomfortable reading but we can either bury our head in the sand and pretend it's not there."" Like Nick Clegg, she also called for the UK to stop selling arms and military equipment to Israel. ""It is wrong for a country to allow arms to be supplied to a potential warzone. It seems odd to have a policy that on the one hand we allow arms to be supplied and on the other we spend taxpayers money patching up the people who may have been injured from the use of those arms,"" she said. ""Therefore we've got to be bold in taking the decision and say until who have been alleged to have committed war crimes over the last few weeks have been brought to justice then we must stop selling arms to Israel."" Warsi said she might not have felt it necessary to resign had she been in another department but she found it too difficult to stand up in the every day and answer foreign policy questions related to the issue. Asked about whether there was a moment that made up her mind, she said: ""There were many moments. Every time a school was bombed. Every time you saw a picture of Gaza with no lights at night. Every time a child about the age of my own children was killed. The moment when young boys playing football on the beach were suddenly there no longer."""	Politics
15247	15248	World Cup 2014: Holland’s Nigel de Jong out of rest of the tournament 	Holland will be without Nigel de Jong for the rest of the through injury. The 29-year-old was forced off nine minutes into the ’s on Sunday with a groin complaint. Holland’s coach, Louis van Gaal, admitted after the last-gasp 2-1 win that De Jong was a doubt for their quarter-final clash against Costa Rica and the Dutch FA has confirmed the midfielder’s tournament is over. A post on read: “Nigel de Jong has a tear in his groin muscle. He’s probably out for two to four weeks. De Jong continues rehabilitation with #Orange.” Van Gaal had described De Jong’s expected absence from Saturday’s quarter-final as a “big setback” so the full severity of the injury will be an even bigger blow. His absence against Costa Rica and potentially beyond will harm Holland’s chances of reaching a second successive World Cup final. The have impressed so far in Brazil but Arjen Robben, speaking before the severity of the injury became clear, admitted De Jong would be a great miss. “It’s a hard blow for us that Nigel has been injured,” the winger said. “The possible absence of De Jong in the quarter-finals is a heavy loss. “But our strength is that every player who comes off the bench on to the pitch manages to have a big impact on the match. The confidence within our team is very big, in spite of any absence.”	Football
8879	8880	The best iPad apps for kids of 2014 	British books and apps publisher Nosy Crow has made a succession of beautiful fairytale apps, all with a strong eye on encouraging reading, not just tapping on interactive whizziness. was their best effort yet, blending storytelling and light gaming with the company’s now-familiar voice narration from children, not grown-ups. Now one of the most well-trusted brands in children’s apps, Toca Boca had another good year in 2014. was its standout app: a creative sandbox for children to grow trees, raise mountains and dig rivers and lakes, to see what kind of wildlife their mini-ecosystem attracts. Wonderful. Sago Sago is the preschool-focused sister studio of Toca Boca, and all of its apps are a treat for children. offers a great way in to its collection though: a road trip starring a colourful cartoon cat and his friends, with different cars to drive and plenty to see and tap on. Scratch is one of the most popular languages used in schools when children are learning computer programming schools. took the idea to tablets this year, from a team including MIT, which was responsible for Scratch. It’s an app that gets children to create stories by slotting together blocks of code: fun and creative. isn’t an app you download: instead, it’s a website that works on tablets. It’s a wonderful thing too: part game and part creative studio where your children draw animals to fill a magical zoo, illustrating their own stories as they go. It’s free, but parents can choose to pay for a subscription that includes a physical zookeeper welcome pack. Based on the well-regarded educational website, was an excellent app introducing children to synthetic phonics, as a complement to their learning in the classroom. Its fun, accessible games introduced the letter sounds although – important note – it’s describing your kids as monsters. Instead, teaching the in-game monster to read is key to the app’s structure. Even art galleries were releasing children’s apps in 2014: from Tate was a treat for children and parents alike. Based on Ruth Green’s charming book, it tells the tale of Sid the Snail, and his efforts to get some sleep. Your children have to draw their own characters while recording their noises, to take part in the story. is impressive: a proper, full-blown Skylanders game to match the console version, complete with its own joypad and portal stand so that kids can use their physical Skylanders toys. The game is free, but you’ll need to buy the physical “tablet starter pack” to play the full thing. Developer Bossa Studios made its name with games like Surgeon Simulator and Thomas Was Alone, which are more for adults. is different though: an excellent educational adventure with a focus on helping children practise their maths skills while saving heroine Twelve’s family. It’s never dry. Another app from Nosy Crow, but this time it wasn’t a story. This was a digital jigsaws app using the artwork from several of the company’s apps and books: one of the best attempts yet to take the idea of piecing puzzles together to the touchscreen. was also a responsible example of in-app purchases: parents could buy extra jigsaws via an in-app store, but if you own other Nosy Crow apps, their puzzles are unlocked for free. The two Star Walk apps have millions of happy adults using them to gaze at the nighttime skies. This year, their developer made a separate app for children: . It’s a cleverly-redesigned version of the adult app, helping kids point their iPad at the stars and learn about some of the constellations – with additional animated short films about the cosmos. Another example of an app for adults spinning off another version for children. Lumosity has millions of people using its main brain-training app, but was strictly for kids: a series of simple, colourful educational mini-games to help them practise core skills like sorting, paying attention and visual-motor coordination. All of developer Originator’s apps are worth a look: followed previous apps Endless Alphabet, Endless Reader and Endless Numbers. This latest app focused on spelling and word building, with a characterful troop of monsters acting out the rhyming puzzles. Nine words are included for free, with other packs available at £2.99 each as in-app purchases. Another developer whose back catalogue is worth digging into is Curious Hat, which makes creative, quirky apps that often aim to get children out into the real world, not just staring into a screen. is a good example: it challenges kids to record one-second videos based on random words, then turns them into mini-movies. Great fun for children, but just as good to collaborate on with you. may have been released for Halloween, but its appeal will last all year round. It gets children to play as a girl named Bonnie, who dresses up in a sheet and floats around the house scaring her family members by jumping out at them and shouting “BOO!”. Genuinely funny, and beautifully designed. The first in a new series of educational apps for children by Disney: is a collection of five mathematical mini-games hosted by Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy and Goofy. They’re elegantly done, with some features available in the free download, and others unlocked by parents through in-app purchases for each game’s zone. All primary-school children should now be learning computer programming skills (or at least “algorithmic thinking”) as part of the curriculum. is one of the apps that aims to help them practise at home: a collection of “coding puzzles” teaching kids about programming, with a sandbox mode to make their own games. In-app purchases buy additional puzzle packs. There are dozens of not-that-good dressing up games for kids, but is a cut above: an app that gets children to create their own outfits for virtual dolls, then snap pictures of them as they strut down a catwalk. As kids get used to it, their creations will get more ambitious, which is wonderful to watch. is a freeform world full of characters – some of whom featured in the company’s previous apps. Children can move them around, interact with items and – crucially – make up their own stories about what’s happening. Every child will discover their own favourite characters and locations, too. The Gruffalo finally got his own app in 2014, although it wasn’t an attempt to retell Julia Donaldson’s story. Instead, was a collection of mini-games based on his world and characters, from playing snap against the terrible-clawed fella himself, through to catching nuts and playing matching pairs. was a good example of one of the interesting children’s app trends of 2014: a move towards a form of digital storytelling that isn’t trying to be just a book, an animation or a game, but something that combines those elegantly. Here, that meant setting off on a quest for dinosaur bones with heroes Doug and Bonnie. The UK-only is the second official app from pre-school channel CBeebies: a collection of digital stories, rather than the games in CBeebies Playtime. Popular characters including Sarah and Duck, Peter Rabbit and Charlie and Lola star, with stories accompanied by questions to provoke discussion with your children. More dinosaurs here, in a well-crafted app by British developer Cowly Owl for young children. features a dinosaur stomping along, and chomping meat or foliage every so often, as it appears. But along the way, eggs appear too, with new parts to help kids mix’n’match their dino bodies. Dr Panda is another well-respected children’s apps brand, with a range of apps offering playful takes on grown-up professions. is pure playtime though: children drive various vehicles around a pair of cities, with a deliberate lack of a storyline to provide space for them to tell their own tales. Another BBC app – and thus, one for British children for now – which ties in to the quiz show spin-off from Horrible Histories. was one of the first mainstream “second screen” apps for kids, designed to be used while watching the TV show. Children answer questions and compete with the on-screen contestants. And it works with the repeats!	Technology
7964	7965	Household incomes 'at 2001-02 levels' 	"Deep recession and sluggish recovery have meant average UK household incomes are no higher than they were in 2001-02, the government has said. Figures from the Department for Work and Pensions showed that another year of stagnating inflation-adjusted earnings had prolonged the UK's lost decade of squeezed incomes. The DWP said median real terms household income growth before housing costs remained unchanged at £440 a week in 2012-13 after two years of falls. After housing costs, median incomes fell for a third consecutive year, from £377 a week to £374 a week. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said there had been a 6% drop in median incomes when adjusted for inflation since the peak, with a 9% fall in mean incomes. The former is calculated by taking the household in the middle of the income distribution, while the latter by dividing total household income by the number of households. ""The large post-recession falls in incomes followed a period of slow income growth that began in the early 2000s, far pre-dating the recession"","" the IFS said. ""The net result is that the official measure shows both measures of average income no higher in 2012–13 than in 2001–02."""	Business
7699	7700	Tories haven’t written off Rochester but have ensured Ukip win is ‘priced in’ 	In the days when he was guaranteed a rock star’s welcome, Tony Blair broke with what he called a daft Westminster convention to campaign in the Uxbridge byelection, something that was traditionally considered beneath the dignity of a prime minister. Labour unsurprisingly failed to capture the safe Tory seat even though the byelection took place within months of Blair’s landslide election win in 1997. But a new convention had been established: prime ministers should no longer remain above the political fray even in byelections. has taken the Blair approach to heart during his time in office and unleashed himself on almost every byelection campaign trail where the Tories are in contention. He takes a simple view: where there are Tory votes up for grabs it is the duty of the Conservative leader to do his or her part in winning them over. The prime minister usually makes a trip or two. But Cameron has cleared large chunks in his diary – his first Cobra meeting since returning from the G20 in Australia after the release of the latest Isis video has been delayed until Tuesday afternoon – to allow him to pay five visits to the Rochester and Strood byelection. The decision dates back to the thinking of about five weeks ago, when the Conservative leadership genuinely believed they had a reasonable chance of winning the seat. This contrasted with their approach to the byelection in Clacton, which the Tories wrote off from the moment Douglas Carswell announced his defection to Ukip at the end of August. The Tories believed there were two key differences between the contest in Clacton and that in Rochester and Strood, triggered by the defection of Carswell’s friend Mark Reckless. In the first place, they believed that the prickly Reckless was a less popular figure. Secondly, they believe that Rochester is a wealthier part of the country, where voters are less likely to fall into the “left behind” category of those deemed by the academics Robert Ford and Matthew Goodwin most likely to vote Ukip. But the Tories acknowledge that the gods will need to be in a generous mood on Thursday if they are to win. Their biggest difficulty is that their candidate, Kelly Tolhurst, is a “challenger candidate”. This is the term to describe a candidate selected late in the proceedings who struggles against an incumbent. The Tories also believe they will fall victim to the classic byelection danger when voters register a protest against the government. “We will lose on Thursday but will win back Rochester and Strood in the general election – unlike Clacton, which is lost for some time,” said one Eurosceptic Tory. It is not impossible that the Tories will win. But it is highly unlikely. This explains why the leadership has been managing expectations downwards. This has had the effect of “pricing in” a Ukip win. That might be the Tories’ greatest achievement of the byelection campaign.	Politics
6166	6167	How Kano turned Patrick, aged eight, into a computer programmer 	"""So we're going to talk to a computer and ask it to change ?"" Patrick, my eight-year-old son, sounds both excited and dubious. ""How will we talk to it?"" ""Well, we'll type in what we want it to do,"" I say, confidently. (Parenting is all about confidence.) ""And it will do what we say? Epic!"" He settles back into his tube seat. Conversation over. ""Can I have a go on your phone?"" I hand over my mobile, my pocket brain, my dazzling portable powerhouse processor that has more than 500,000 times the memory of the computer that landed Apollo 11 on the moon. My son takes it as casually as if it were a packet of crisps, types in my security code and starts playing . On 19 November last year, a new project was launched on . As with most of the ideas on the site, the world's largest crowdfunding platform, there was a video clip that explained what investors' money would be supporting. In the clip, two young men, Alex Klein and Yonatan Raz-Fridman, talked to camera while messing about in a children's playground. Their project – an easy-to-assemble computer kit for children, based around the micro circuit board – was called . Inserts showed youngsters raving about it, a slam poet extolling it, the creator of the pioneering video game Pong enthusing about its potential. The clip finished with Klein and Raz-Fridman going up and down on a seesaw. See? Child's play. Project Kano's funding target was $100,000: if the target was achieved, the Kano computer kits would ship in June and July of 2014. In less than 18 hours, $100,000 was clocked up, leaving a month to go until the funding deadline, 19 December. By that time, Project Kano had raised $1,522,160, from 13,387 backers. Two of those backers were , who designed the first Apple computer, and , one of the founders of Kickstarter. Another one was me. Patrick and I are visiting Kano's office. Just a box, really, in a small avenue near Old Street, east London; a space with 10 or so young people of various nationalities sitting at computers, chatting sometimes, mostly not. Klein – flop-haired, gangle-limbed, 23 – takes us into a small side room, where a prototype Kano is laid out in its cardboard case. It consists of a , an SD card with the Kano logo on, a specially designed small orange keyboard, a plug, a Wi-Fi dongle, a little speaker, a click-together box to hold the Pi and various brightly coloured leads. ""Can I have a go?"" Patrick makes the Kano himself. He ignores the accompanying booklet and just plugs bits into the Pi, like he's building Lego – the SD card in first, then he clips the plug together. In a few minutes, he's done and we find ourselves gazing at a TV screen that fills with streams of code, ASCII typewriter-style stuff like I used to see in my short year of computer science lessons (1982-83). The code spools down like green rain. Suddenly, the screen is blank. The cursor flashes, then types out: ""Hi, I'm Kano. Thanks for bringing me to life. What should I call you?"" ""Patrick"", types Patrick. ""Patrick, follow the white rabbit,"" Kano responds; , like . A few clicks later and Patrick is controlling a environment. He's dragging and dropping instructions, typing in measurements, clipping commands together in blocks. He creates a house, in one go. What he's doing, though he doesn't know it, is coding. He can do this because Kano has made it instinctive: Kano Blocks, which he is using, represents computer code (Python, JavaScript, with more to come) as visual jigsaw pieces. Not that he cares (nor me). We're too busy discussing building a tower out of TNT and exploding it with lava. Then we make some synth music and have a go at Pong, changing the sizes of the paddles, making the ball big and orange, speeding it up. Pong is a big success with Patrick. I have to prise him away. Before Klein became involved in Kano, he studied ethics, politics and economics at Yale, and then did a masters in political economy at Cambridge. He liked programming, but he also liked acting and story-telling. He became a . One of the stories he covered was the Raspberry Pi. This small circuit board, the size of a credit card, was launched at the beginning of 2012 and became an instant success. Developed in Britain by Cambridge graduates who wanted to make computers and coding accessible to everyone, the Pi has given rise to an enthusiastic tech community, who use their Pi to create all sorts of amazing things: a robot camera that sends down photos from a balloon, a habitat for insects, a theatre lighting rig. But there were those – and I am one of them – who found the Pi intimidating. To make it work, you had to do everything: locate a spare keyboard, plus all the right leads, work out the Wi-Fi, program the SD card. Still, the tech-literate loved the Pi, including Klein, who ""hacked about with it"". He showed it to his younger cousin (Micah, aged seven – he's in the Kickstarter film), but Micah found it too difficult. Another story Klein covered was Occupy's Wall Street camp at Zuccotti Park. While sheltering from the rain in one of their tents, he asked the Occupy-ers why, if they hated big business so much, they all used iPhones and Samsungs. ""I said, because I'm a bit of a nerd, 'Why don't you join the open source movement? Free software, protocols that allow for minimising government or institutional surveillance and maximising individual control over technology.' I gave them the whole spiel. And they said, 'Yeah, that's fine – but these things aren't designed for us, they are designed by the Silicon Valley elite. The open source community are geeks and nerds and they created the current inequality in technology.' And when they hit me with that, I was like, 'OK, you're right.' "" Klein and Raz-Fridman, 30, an ex-intelligence officer for the Israel defence forces, thought they could use the Raspberry Pi's cheapness and open source software's flexibility to make computer coding easier for non-techy people: ""for fun, and purpose"". After all, if you're a non-tech person (and you can afford it), you are stuck with Apple, Sony, Nintendo, Samsung: slick, pretty, closed-off life accessories/computers that are far too expensive for you to risk prising the back off and having a look at what's inside, far too enmeshed in their own operating systems for you to hack in and have a mess around. Klein thought about this. He talked about it. He had an advantage: his cousin Saul (father of Micah) is an investment entrepreneur who co-founded LoveFilm, put money into and was an executive at Skype. Saul knows how digital startups should run; he also understood that the Raspberry Pi wasn't quite as accessible as everyone had hoped. He was up for Klein and Raz-Fridman's idea. ""For me, the notion with Kano,"" says Klein, ""on a micro level, was, 'Let's make a really fun computer kit for all ages.' And then, on a macro level, it was to link niche technology to people to help break down the social frameworks we've created in the past three decades. Gross social inequality, a management class that is more centralised than it's ever been since the Great Depression. And an economy that has tons of top-heavy growth, but none of the broadly distributed growth that was characteristic of, say, the 50s and 60s. That's the macro story."" What Kano wants to do, then, is give power to the people. There is a coding frenzy out there. Money is pouring into it, from hedge funders speculating on programming startups to ordinary people inspired to back projects such as the coding-for-infants toy . Michael Gove has made coding part of the national curriculum: all secondary schools must teach coding, and primary schools introduce it, from September 2014. Recently, I heard Tony Hall, the head of the BBC, say in a speech that there were three languages in the world: English, Mandarin and code (a slightly hackneyed maxim, but still). Hall's enthusiasm means that BBC producers are currently scouting out all tech startups, phoning known coding gurus, asking them for Big Ideas. The Great British Code-Off? Strictly Come Coding? That kind of stuff. More prosaically, schools are rushing around, frantically trying to skill up their teachers so that they can teach code. is an organisation that puts schools in touch with computer developers so they can help run after-school clubs for nine- to 11-year-olds. It is overwhelmed with requests. I know, because Patrick's school is one of them. No luck as yet: every available programmer is run off his or her feet, with a full-time job and umpteen help-me asks. runs and , which bring self-taught programmers together, inviting them to events where they use open source data to make websites and apps that solve real-world problems. When she started Young Rewired State in 2009, with a one-day event, only three children turned up. Now, however, YRS is thriving and Mulqueeny has noticed changes. ""The kids used to say, 'We'd tell our friends that we spend time doing this,' "" she says. ""But now they're proud – they give talks to their year groups. ""We used to get the stereotypical, 15- to 18-year-old, isolated geek,"" she says. ""Now, we're seeing 10-, 11-, 12-year-olds, more mainstream kids who might be brilliant at maths and were introduced to coding by their parents."" Brilliant at maths... hmm. Can everyone code? At the moment, coding is presented as an easy route to a well-paid programming job, as though every child will latch on to it and zoom from , where you get a cartoon cat to walk into walls, to complicated programming languages such as C++. But some people's minds don't work like that. You can show a group of kids an engine and only a few will want to take it apart to see how it works. Not everyone can code well enough to be a programmer. ""No,"" agrees Mulqueeny. ""But children should have a degree of computational thinking. They should know that Google is an algorithm and what an algorithm is. If you introduce junior school children to the vocabulary of code, then it might spark an interest. And all kids need digital skills, so they're not only safe but in control of their digital world. Our kids' computer literacy at the moment is naff all."" (As an aside, she recommends that out-of-work 16-year-olds should have a go at learning Ruby, the programming language most often used in making mobile apps.) We have an interesting talk about teaching. Mulqueeny believes that, fundamentally, coding lessons challenge much more than teachers' skills. They challenge what a teacher is. ""The traditional model is that the teacher imparts knowledge to the children,"" she says. ""But if there aren't enough teachers with the knowledge, why not just let the kids teach themselves? Give them a list of websites and let them try stuff out."" She recommends , an American organisation that teaches coding by video in steps. ""Or just go to YouTube and use it as your own private tutor. If you get stuck, ask Twitter."" There are teachers who are already coders (check out the inspirational Alan O'Donohoe, on Twitter), but they are rare. After all, unless it's their hobby, why would teachers be computer savvy? Their work internet network is closed; very few of them have everyday experience of footering on the net, messing about on social networks, trawling YouTube, playing internet games, messaging friends, encountering safe and unsafe environments. They live different digital lives to their pupils. So different, in fact, that some secondary schools send letters home telling parents not to let their teenagers on to Facebook or Instagram. You might as well demand that they don't fiddle with their bits. We're on our way home from Kano. I'm thinking about their office and realise what it reminds me of: my old office at magazine in the 90s. A small, motivated, slightly odd team of people who don't quite fit in anywhere else, obsessing about stuff they love. I also remember a quote that Mike D from Beastie Boys gave me back in those days. He said: ""You can be entrepreneurial without being exploitative."" Klein said to me: ""For a long time, the notion was, you build a business by doing whatever the hell you want, and then you institute a corporate social responsibility programme and throw a few bucks back. But the model that I think is growing now, and you see it with and with Toms Shoes, is … a realpolitik notion. For better or worse, we live in some of the most free-market times in history, and thus the lever to most quickly and effectively be an influence on the world is the free market. People can sponsor Kano kits to get them to Nairobi, or Johannesburg, or north London. It's all possible."" It's easy to be seduced by smooth gadgets that help you live your life. But there's a whole world out there that isn't as shiny, isn't as owned by corporations. It's possible to like Beyoncé and John Grant; to love your iPad and your notepad; to visit the Science Museum and go home and make a rocket out of Lego and land it on a football moon. Sometimes, my children spend hours playing computer games. Sometimes, they spend hours making homemade badges. They don't see the difference, really. If you allow kids in – to a museum, an institution, inside a closed world – they'll find a way to have fun. Patrick is back on on my phone. He looks up. ""I really liked that,"" he says. ""It was one of my favourite days. Can we get a Kano? I want to play with that Pong game."""	Technology
4372	4373	Android Wear: the nine best free apps for Google's smartwatch 	"Google’s smartwatches have , but apps that show off what a good smartwatch can do have already appeared. Running on Wear, Google's smartwatch-specific software, the best apps are beginning to show the potential for wearable gadgets. Here's nine of the best. Dictating voice notes into your watch has never been so much fun. The allows users to pull up recent notes on their smartwatch – more useful than it sounds if you’re travelling and have book references and other things on your wrist – as well as dictate new notes without having to pull out a smartphone. Google’s free Evernote competitor, puts notes and lists on your wrist – great for shopping lists – and allows users to dictate new notes much like the Evernote app. If This Then That, or IFTTT, is one of the most powerful services to grace smart devices and the web. It performs a set action if an event happens, like firing off a text message to your phone if you receive an email from your boss, or automatically uploading photos to Dropbox that you post to Instagram. On the wrist gives users a big button that triggers some user configurable action. Perhaps that’s turning off all the lights in your house, or sending a canned response to friends and family via text message. It could even turn off your Nest thermostat, if you have one installed. The possibilities are numerous. Fitness trackers should be quaking in their boots right now, because smartwatches seem to be able to do pretty much anything they can do. Android Wear has built-in step counting (which compared to a ) but takes it a stage further offering much more information and run tracking. It provides at-a-glance information on your run pace, distance and calorie burning, plugging into the existing service and app, which starts free with an option to upgrade to a monthly ""elite"" service for $9.99 (£5.85 in the UK) a month. is a similar app that does the same job and which one you pick up is probably determined by which one you already use on your phone. Google’s built-in mapping for Android Wear works surprisingly well for walking directions, vibrating when it’s time to take another street complete with on-screen directions. It saves pulling out a smartphone and making yourself a mugging target when out on the street. Showing that Android Wear is just as adaptable on a smartwatch as Android is on a smartphone, is a custom application launcher for your watch. To access apps normally you have to launch them via voice, or dig into the apps menu about three scrolls down within the search app. Wear Mini Launcher shows a draw of all the Android Wear apps installed on your smartwatch, which appears with a quick swipe from the top left. The free app is so well integrated it looks like it should be baked into Android Wear; it even allows you to quickly adjust the screen brightness with a small slider. LG claims that the G Watch will still connect to a smartphone some 15m away, which gives quite a lot of potential for inadvertently leaving your phone behind somewhere while engrossed by something on your smartwatch. lets you know when you’re leaving your phone behind by buzzing on your wrist when out of range and allows users to trigger the phone’s alarm sound to find it if it’s buried in the sofa. An app that shows the potential of Android Wear-powered smartwatches as part of the Internet of Things movement we’ve been heading towards for about 10 years. is essentially a button on your watch that connects to a Lockitron-powered lock (a door lock controlled by a smartphone). One press and your door unlocks. Not particularly useful unless you have a Lockitron setup for your house, but shows that a smartwatch could be a great device for controlling and interacting with various connected devices as they become dotted around the home. New apps appear on the Google Play store on a daily basis, so if you spot any good ones you think people should know about, tell us about them in the comments below."	Technology
15187	15188	Nokia losing market share 	"Mobile telephone maker yesterday rattled investors with news that it is losing market share to its rivals. It also warned second quarter earnings would be below market expectations. The double blow sent Nokia's shares tumbling almost 10% to €12 as investors switched into other mobile phone makers' stock. Nokia chairman and chief executive Jorma Ollila said yesterday that, while the overall mobile market had grown by 29%, Nokia's sales had increased by a more pedestrian 19% in the first three months of the year. That meant Nokia's share of the global market had fallen to 35%, compared with its own target of about 40%. Nokia acknowledged that sales of its phones in Europe and the United States were hit by gaps in its product range. It said it had already introduced a number of new models, including its first fashion cate gory clamshell model, and expected to launch a total of 40 this year, although shipments of the new phones will come through mainly in the second half. ""There have been execution delays. We should have been six months ahead, ideally, with new product introductions,"" Mr Ollila said. Overall, Nokia sales, including networks, multimedia and enterprise solutions as well as phones, fell 2% to €6.6bn (£4.4bn), though Nokia said they were up 7% in constant currency terms. Earnings per share for the first three months were a better than expected €0.17, but Nokia warned that in the second quarter they would be in the range of €0.13 to €0.15, well below the €0.19 recorded in the second quarter of 2003. ""This is bad, there is no room for explanations ... The second quarter will be weakish and eyes are already on the second half,"" according to advice from Jussi Hoyty, an analyst at FIM Securities."

13417	13418	Luis Suárez could face ban after appearing to punch Chile defender 	"Luis Suárez is waiting to learn whether his latest brush with controversy will result in an extended international suspension which could sideline him from Uruguay's remaining World Cup qualifiers. The sometimes notoriously short-fused striker played for Uruguay in their 2-0 defeat against Chile in Santiago on Tuesday evening when he appeared to aim a punch in the direction of an opponent's face. Televised replays showed a coming together involving Suárez and Gonzalo Jara, the defender, following which Suárez appeared to aim a blow towards Jara's head. Although Jara – currently on loan at Nottingham Forest from West Bromwich Albion – did not go to ground, the pair immediately became embroiled in a verbal altercation but the referee, Nestor Pitana, took no action. Pitana did, however subsequently book Suárez for protesting over an unrelated incident, thereby dictating that he will be suspended for Uruguay's next qualifier, against Venezuela. Depending on the content of the referee's report – which is scheduled to be submitted to Fifa by Thursday – football's international ruling body could take retrospective action over the clash with Jara. The implementation of any sanction will hinge on whether the referee, or any of his officials, saw the exchange or not. In a statement issued in response to inquires about the Liverpool striker, Fifa said: ""We are still collecting all the post-match international reports, since the officials have got 24 hours to send them. Based on the mentioned reports, Fifa will proceed accordingly."" The defeat means now occupy sixth place in the group – two places behind Chile – and leaves them outside the top four automatic World Cupqualification places with the much coveted Suárez contemplating missing out on Brazil 2014 in addition to Champions League football with Liverpool next season."

Amazon has been offering discounts all week while Asda, owned by US retailer Walmart, is planning a sale in its stores including offers of up to 70% off a range of products including plasma TVs and tablets. is running a one-day Black Friday sale in stores and online partly because Apple will be offering discounts and its ""never knowingly undersold"" price pledge means it must match cheaper prices elsewhere. Apple's iPad Air is expected to be one of the department store's bestsellers this Christmas. Andrew Moore, Asda's chief merchandising officer for general goods, said: ""The last weekend in November is always a critical trading period in retail and with our Black Friday deals – a first for a UK supermarket – we're anticipating the busiest shopping day of the year so far."" He said would also be offering online deals on Monday. The focus on discounting during retailers' biggest sales period when many stores make the majority of their annual profits is a risky new trend. It comes as retailers expect shoppers to spend £40.3bn in the runup to Christmas. That total is just 3.5% more than last year, as wage rises have failed to keep up with inflation. More than 25m British consumers are expected to spend in pre-Christmas sales this year, spending an average £174 each according to research from RedEye, which claims that more than half of shoppers will shun the January sales in favour of finding discounts in November and December. Mark Patron, chief executive of RedEye, said: ""Britain has become a nation of discount junkies."" Mark Lewis, online director at John Lewis, said that the retailer had decided to launch its own deals this year, as well as price-matching competitors' discounts, because the Black Friday idea was catching on with British shoppers. ""Black Friday has really caught the imagination of our customers. Last year we felt they really engaged with it and so we would go a step further."" He said that interest would kick off early in the morning as shoppers used their mobile phones to get the best deals as soon as they woke up in the same way as they did during the recent launches of the games console XBox One and Apple's latest gadget, the iPad Air. Online sales are expected to peak on Sunday and Monday, but shoppers are increasingly prepared to spend closer to Christmas as delivery services become more reliable. Many stores will now deliver up until 23 December."	Business
10683	10684	Eurozone debt crisis: why the Greece deal will work 	ow that Greek banks have reopened and the government has made scheduled payments to the and the International Monetary Fund, does Greece’s near-death experience mark the end of the eurozone crisis? The conventional answer is a clear no. According to most economists and political commentators, the latest Greek bailout was little more than an analgesic. It will dull the pain for a short period, but the euro’s deep-seated problems will metastasize, with a dismal prognosis for the single currency and perhaps even the as a whole. But the conventional wisdom is likely to be proved wrong. The deal between Greece and the European authorities is actually a good one for both sides. Rather than marking the beginning of a new phase of the euro crisis, the agreement may be remembered as the culmination of a long series of political compromises that, by correcting some of the euro’s worst design flaws, created the conditions for a European economic recovery. To express guarded optimism about the Greek deal is not to condone the provocative arrogance of former Greek finance minister or the pointless vindictiveness of the German finance minister, . Neither is it to deny the economic criticism of the bailout provisions presented by progressives such as and conservatives such . The arguments against creating a European single currency and then allowing Greece to cheat its way into membership were valid back in the 1990s – and, in theory, they still are. But this does not mean that breaking up the euro would be desirable, or even tolerable. Joining the euro was certainly ruinous for Greece, but there is always “a great deal of ruin in a nation,” as Adam Smith remarked 250 years ago, when losing the US colonies seemed to threaten Britain with financial devastation. The great virtue of capitalism is that it adapts to ruinous conditions and even finds ways of turning them to its advantage. The US, in the mid-19th century, was badly suited for a single currency and a single economic structure, as evidenced by the Civil War, which was provoked as much by single-currency tensions as by moral abhorrence to slavery. Italy would probably be better off today if Giuseppe Garibaldi had never launched unification. But once unification has happened, the pain of dismantling the political and economic settlement usually overwhelms the apparent gains from a break-up. This seems to be the case in , as clear majorities of voters are saying in all eurozone countries, including Germany and Greece. Thus, the question was never whether the single currency would break up, but what political reversals, economic sacrifices, and legal subterfuges would occur to hold it together. The good news is that Europe now has some persuasive answers. Indeed, Europe has overcome what could be described as the “original sin” of the single-currency project: the Maastricht Treaty’s prohibition of “monetary financing” of government deficits by the ECB and the related ban on mutual support by national governments of one another’s debt burdens. In January, the ECB president, Mario Draghi, effectively sidestepped both obstacles by launching a programme of so enormous that it will finance the entire deficits of all eurozone governments (now including Greece) and mutualise a significant proportion of their outstanding bonds. Moreover, European governments have belatedly understood the most basic principle of public finance. Government debts never have to be repaid, provided they can be extended in a cooperative manner or bought up with newly created money, issued by a credible central bank. But for this to be possible, interest payments must always be made on time, and the sanctity of debt contracts must always take precedence over electoral promises regarding pensions, wages, and public spending. Now that Alexis Tsipras’s government has been forced to acknowledge the unqualified priority of debt servicing, and can now benefit from unlimited monetary support from the ECB, Greece should have little problem supporting its debt burden, which is no heavier than Japan’s or Italy’s. Finally, Germany, Spain, Italy, and several northern European countries required, for domestic political reasons, a ritual humiliation of radical Greek politicians and voters who openly defied EU institutions and austerity demands. Having achieved this, EU leaders have no further reason to impose austerity on Greece or strictly enforce the terms of the latest bailout. Instead, they have every incentive to demonstrate the success of their “tough love” policies by easing austerity to accelerate economic growth, not only in Greece but throughout the eurozone. This raises a key issue that the Tsipras government and many others misunderstood throughout the Greek crisis: the role of constructive hypocrisy in Europe’s political economy. Gaps between public statements and private intentions open up in all political systems, but these become huge in a complex multinational structure such as the EU. On paper, the Greek bailout will impose a fiscal tightening, thereby aggravating the country’s economic slump. In practice, however, the budget targets will surely be allowed to slip, provided the government carries out its promises on privatisation, labour markets, and pension reform. These structural reforms are much more important than fiscal targets, both in symbolic terms for the rest of Europe and for the Greek economy. Moreover, the extension of ECB monetary support to Greece will transform financial conditions: interest rates will plummet, banks will recapitalise, and private credit will gradually become available for the first time since 2010. If budget targets were strictly enforced by bailout monitors, which seems unlikely, this improvement in conditions for private borrowers could easily compensate for any modest tightening of fiscal policy. In short, the main conditions now seem to be in place for a sustainable recovery in Greece. Conventional wisdom among economists and investors has a long record of failing to spot major turning points; so the near-universal belief today that Greece faces permanent depression is no reason to despair. , 2015	Business
8332	8333	World stock markets plunge as global crisis deepens 	World markets plunged to their lowest level this year as and sparked renewed fears of a global slowdown. As traders sold off shares in favour of safer assets such as gold, the FTSE 100 in London fell 1.14% to close at 5260.19, its lowest level since 25 November last year. European markets also ended sharply lower, with Germany's Dax down nearly 3.5%, France's Cac down 2.2% and Spain's Ibex off by 0.4%. In the US, the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen more than 220 points - or 1.8% - by the time London closed. After overnight falls in Asia following signs of a slowdown in China, the MSCI world index hit its lowest level since December. The day's economic data went from bad to worse, with the eurozone manufacturing sector suffering its worst month since June 2009 and its jobless rate hitting a record high of 11%. In the UK the manufacturing sector sufferered its second-biggest fall in 20 years, according to the latest purchasing managers' index. Then came the widely watched US non-farm payroll numbers, which showed a rise in employment of just 69,000 in May, compared with forecasts of a 150,000 gain. This was the third set of disappointing numbers, while April's gain of 115,000 jobs was revised down to an increase of 77,000. That prompted an immediate fall in the US dollar against the euro and the yen, with unconfirmed talk the Bank of Japan might have intervened to help stop the slide in the US currency. All this added to growing fears the eurozone crisis was spiralling out of control. With Spain increasingly in the firing line, the cost of insuring its debt against default hit a record high. The move followed reports that Spain will not announce details of a mechanism to ease the funding problems of its heavily indebted regions today, as hoped. In Greece left wing leader Alexis Tsipras, gaining ground in the opinion polls ahead of this month's election, ratcheted up his rhetoric against the EU's bailout terms for the country. He repeated his pledge to rip up the bailout agreement if elected, and threatened to take Greece out of Nato. Signs that Ireland had voted in favour of the European fiscal treaty in Thursday's referendum did little to soothe investors' nerves. But gold gained ground, adding around 3% to $1,613 as traders sought safer assets. With the global economy running out of steam, oil was on the slide, with Brent crude falling more than 3% to $98 a barrel.	Business
13276	13277	Panini’s World Cup sticker factory – São Paulo’s mecca for collectors 	n an unprepossessing industrial suburb, about a 45-minute drive out of São Paulo, is where football fans will find Willy Wonka’s factory. Like many buildings in the main city, it does not look like much from the outside – in fact, it looks disarmingly small – but this may well be a ruse to put off the less myopically devoted because inside is a veritable mecca for football (and sticker) fans. For this, you see, is Panini HQ. Shelves of Panini-published comic books line the reception (including a rather charming series based on the adventures of Neymar, and the Brazilian footballer’s hair does make a lot more sense in comic-book form). But let’s be honest, most people are here for the stickers, and the peeks into boxes going in and out of the warehouse, stuffed with sheathes of team photos, are nigh on torture for the dedicated collector who is still missing those final dozen elusive stickers and the has already started. And shinies! There’s a whole box of shiny stickers just by that machine and … But before we come over all Augustus Gloop and start stuffing our pockets with that final player from Russia and that sodding goalkeeper from the Korea Republic, let’s try to act like adults – and adults do make up, Panini estimates, at least half their customer base these days (and at least three-quarters of those adults, by my estimate, lie to the newsagent and say they’re buying stickers for their children). So let’s first make vaguely professional small talk with Mr Panini himself, José Eduardo Martins, its delightfully smooth-talking chief executive in . “Although I’m a little hoarse today as I was cheering so much last night at the football!” chortles the ol’ (slightly husky) smoothy. Martins had, like the football fan he is, been at the opening game the night before and his respect for stickers is as wholehearted as that of any devotee. When he talks about the excitement of “buying a pack, and thinking: ‘Oh! Maybe the one I need will be in here!’”, his eyes pop. When friends ask him for the occasional sticker freebie, he is quite rightly indignant: “When Volkswagen releases a new model no one asks people who work there for a free car.” Panini is, as the name suggests, an Italian company, but it has had a factory near São Paulo since 1989, which provides stickers to all of South America and Latin America, while the one in Modena, Italy, attends to everyone else’s sticker needs. , with sales increasing by what Martins modestly estimates as 50%. The publication of the World Cup albums, with their 640 squares waiting to be filled with the faces of every football player, plus those all important shinies, is rightly described by Martins as “the real launch of the World Cup”. Sales are up this World Cup in nearly all the 100 countries in which the stickers are sold, but Brazil is by far the largest consumer, with twice as many sticker sales as Germany, its only real competitor in the sticker aficionado stakes. A lot of this, of course, is to do with the World Cup happening in Brazil: Panini sticker collecting has become a sign of patriotism, with even Brazil’s president, Dilma Rousseff, claiming that she winds down after a hard day of international politics by swapping stickers with her three-year-old grandson. But it has also become a form of Brazilian socialising: huge meets are organised on social media so fans can swap stickers in malls and other public spaces. “My theory is that it’s because of the internet. You have 1,000 friends on Facebook, but how many do you see every day? You don’t have 1,000 friends, you just maybe communicate with 1,000 people,” says Martins, telling it like it is. “I think people like to meet, and this is an opportunity.” Although Panini doesn’t release sales figures due to a confidentiality agreement with Fifa, Martins can say that since February, the small factory in São Paulo has printed nine million stickers a day on its 21 machines – the one in Modena, which is bigger, has been printing over 11 million a day – and the staff on the factory floor have been working round the clock to meet the demand. Over 65 million Panini sticker albums have been published for this World Cup. “What other publishing company prints 65 million copies of anything?” he says. “Except the Bible, maybe. We are the Bible!” News stories reflecting South America’s biblical love for Panini stickers became as common in the runup to the World Cup as anguished sports pieces about the fitness of various players: (“Something always happens in Rio!” laughs Martins), and the tale of . One misguided soul tried to sue Panini for £50,000, claiming that his son had suffered “depression and illness” after failing to receive a sticker he ordered. “That was a nuisance,” tuts Martins. But Panini takes its relationship with customers very seriously, and Martins says: “If customers tell us they want us to make scratch and sniff stickers, we listen.” So far, no one has requested a scratch and sniff Wayne Rooney. To prove his devotion to his public, Martins listens solemnly to conspiracy theories about collecting, and he replies to them with surprising candour. He reveals that, just as Panini collectors have long suspected, “yes you can” improve your chances of finishing your collection if you buy stickers from different vendors because of the way the stickers are distributed. He pooh-poohs the rumour that they deliberately restrict the number of a team’s stickers in that team’s country as a sales tactic (“Ha ha! No.”). Does Panini get annoyed when their team lineups turn out to be – how to put this delicately – wrong? Ashley Cole, for one, is in the England lineup in the album. “I say, our teams aren’t wrong, they’re different. Back in 2010 we selected Ronaldinho and the coach chose Kaká, who was injured and we were eliminated – so who was really wrong?” And finally, what the hell has happened to the England team? Not on the pitch – in the stickers. Whereas all the other teams are pictured in their kit, the England players appear be Photoshopped into plain white T-shirts. Worse, instead of having a proper team photo, they are instead a weird collection of floating heads. “Hahaha! It’s annoying, no?” he laughs. Yes, it is. The reason, English fans may not be surprised to learn, is the FA. They may be more surprised to learn that it is also due to Robert Maxwell. Up until 1988, Panini UK had an agreement with the FA and was allowed to use images. But then Maxwell bought Panini and the directors of Panini UK broke away: “You’re from the UK so you understand: Maxwell did not have a very good reputation there, right?” smiles Martins. These directorsThey formed their own company, Merlin, and took the rights with them. Merlin was then taken over by Topps and the result is that England are the only World Cup team that Panini can’t reproduce with logos or emblems, which is why the players all look like they’re wearing bibs in the photos. “We have made offers for Topps, though not directly – we definitely want [the rights from the FA.] Topps stickers are not the same quality as ours,” he shrugs. Downstairs in the factory, it is almost impossible to believe that nine million stickers are processed and packaged every day. The factory floor is about the size of a small school auditorium and, while the cutting and mixing machines make an impressive amount of noise, the most striking thing about it is how manual it is: the machines are all fed by hand and over 70 workers walk calmly around with giant sheets of players’ images before slicing them, mixing them and packaging them. Even more amazing is the request room, where inquiries for specific stickers come in. The factory currently receives over 8,000 requests a day and these are filled by a handful of women diligently fetching stickers out of cubbyholes and then filling envelopes. “Women are more attentive than men. They are better at detail. It’s true!” Martins grins. So come on, José. If we can’t, in all good conscience, ask for our missing stickers, tell us at least the secret to completing a Panini sticker album before the World Cup. “Start collecting in April or May. You need to buy about 100, 110 packs of stickers. Then get out there and swap with your friends! Swap! It’s fun, no?”	Football
3875	3876	Hillsborough footage shot by police may have been edited, court hears 	"Police footage of the Hillsborough football ground on the day of the 1989 tragedy may have been deliberately edited, according to a barrister for families who lost relatives in the disaster. Pete Weatherby QC, representing 21 bereaved families at a court hearing in London considering procedures for the new inquest into the deaths, asked that an independent expert be appointed to examine the film. Weatherby said an initial view from an expert for the families who had viewed the film suggested it may have been tampered with. There were apparent differences in the way the film, shot from a police handheld camera, cut to different scenes on the day. Much of it was also of poor quality, Weatherby said. ""I would submit an expert should look at this to ensure they are the best possible copies,"" he said. The call was echoed by Sam Leek QC, representing Operation Resolve, the new police investigation into whether manslaughter or other criminal offences were committed by South Yorkshire police, Sheffield Wednesday football club, the Football Association or other parties or individuals responsible for Hillsborough. Leek said the ""provenance"" of all film and audio-visual evidence was difficult to establish almost 25 years on, and also argued an independent expert should be appointed by the coroner to examine it. The quality and provenance of police evidence relating to Hillsborough is hugely significant due to the families' assertion that South Yorkshire police covered up their culpability for the disasterincluding by amending and editing junior police officers' statements. Families of the 96 victims have maintained deep suspicion over film and CCTV evidence throughout their campaign, after it emerged that two video tapes of CCTV were stolen from the locked control room at Hillsborough on the night of the disaster. No one was ever caught or convicted for that theft. At the pre-inquest hearing, four former senior South Yorkshire police officers who were involved in the editing and amending of statements, applied and were accepted by the coroner, Lord Justice Goldring, as parties to the inquest. Chris Daw QC, representing retired police chief superintendents Terry Wain and Donald Denton, said they were ""responsible for gathering and presenting South Yorkshire police's case"" after Hillsborough. ""They are adamant the work they undertook was not in any sense a cover-up,"" said Daw. The Independent Police Complaints Commission, which is investigating the alleged cover-up and possible offences of perjury and perverting the course of justice by police officers after Hillsborough, said it had interviewed 57 of 220 surviving officers whose statements were altered. Goldring, while acknowledging the huge scale and complexity of the evidence relating to Hillsborough and its aftermath, insisted that the inquest would start on the planned date of 31 March next year."

5610	5611	Michael Moore tells documentary-makers to be more entertaining 	"Documentary film-makers have lost sight of why people like to go to the cinema, said Michael Moore during his keynote speech at the . The Oscar-winning film-maker is in town to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Roger & Me, his movie on the closure of General Motors plants in his hometown of Flint, Michigan. He used his talk to criticise the joyless nature of many modern documentaries and said that many film-makers, particularly on the left, had lost their sense of humour. ""People don't want medicine, they want popcorn,"" he said. ""Entertainment is the big dirty word of documentary. 'Oh no! I've entertained someone. I've cheapened my movie!'"" Moore recalled taking a cinema seat around in a van when he shot Roger & Me (""to remind the crew about the audience""). ""If you want to make a speech, join a political party,"" he said. ""If you want to give a sermon become a priest. Want to give a lecture? Be a teacher. Make a movie! If you make a movie, people might go and see your documentary."" Moore's 2004 film, , is the highest-grossing documentary of all time, taking close to $120m (£75m) at the US box office to date. The film, which won the Palme d'Or at the 2004 Cannes film festival, uses Moore's trademark mix of comedy, factual analysis and on-camera confrontation to deliver a stinging attack on the Bush administration's case for the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the subsequent lack of dissent by the press. The director, who won the best-documentary Oscar for his 2003 film, , suggested that documentaries should be judged as an entertainment product like any other – as something to entertain on a night out. ""People want to go home and have sex after your movie,"" he said. ""Don't make them feel 'Urggggghhhh'. Don't do that to your fellow sexually active people. ""If you can't accept that you're an entertainer with your truth, get out of the business,"" he said. ""[America] needs more teachers ... and we need to pay them Hollywood wages."" Moore's speech, which overran by almost double its allotted time (""I told them I wouldn't go more than 50% longer than Fidel would normally do""), was well-received by an audience that included a good number of his fellow documentary film-makers. He said he hoped that a resurgence in the form was not far off, but that directors needed to stop looking for excuses as to why their films weren't getting a bigger audience. ""Blame studios, blame distributors, blame financiers, but let's take a moment to blame ourselves,"" he said."	Film
2712	2713	E.ON fined £7.75m for overcharging customers 	Energy giant has been fined nearly £8m for incorrectly charging customers – the second time in two years. Energy regulator imposed the £7.75m penalty after it discovered E.ON was incorrectly charging exit fees and overcharging customers following price rises in 2013 and 2014. Under the regulator’s rules, suppliers have to give customers 30 days’ notice of a price rise to allow people a chance to switch to another supplier if they want to. If a customer tells their supplier they are going to move within that time, they should not be charged an exit fee or the higher energy price even if the switch takes place after the price rise. E.ON failed to follow these rules. It has already paid back £400,000 to customers who may have been affected. Those were direct debit and standard credit customers who signalled their intention to switch within the 30 day period before price rises kicked in in January 2013 and January 2014. However, E.ON later discovered that 7,000 customers on prepayment meters were also affected and is now tracking them down to refund them by the end of April. Ofgem described the delay as serious and said it took this into account when deciding the fine. The money will go to Citizens Advice to help vulnerable consumers. The penalty also takes into account that E.ON made the same billing error in 2012, This time the average repayment is about £8 for direct debit customers and £12 for standard credit customers. The average refund for those on pre-payment meters is £3.42. “E.ON’s errors meant customers who took the chance to switch were wrongly charged,” said Sarah Harrison, senior partner in charge of enforcement at Ofgem. “It is important that E.ON has repaid potentially affected customers and cooperated with the investigation. “However, it’s absolutely unacceptable that E.ON failed to provide these vital customer protections yet again and this persistent failure is the reason for the high penalty.” E.On apologised to those affected. In a statement it said: “Following reports from E.ON, Ofgem opened an investigation into the errors in June 2014 and has agreed today’s penalty package in recognition of the company’s errors. These errors meant that some customers were overcharged, although in the majority of cases this was by less than £10.” Thursday’s fine will add to the growing tide of customer resentment against badly behaving energy companies. Last month, and the previous month At the end of last year, British Gas, SSE and Scottish Power Earlier this year, . People were asked to pick which two or three villains from a rogue’s gallery of businesses that they most disliked, and 46% picked gas and electricity suppliers – more than any other sector.	Business
3872	3873	Football: McClaren to drop Robinson for Carson 	"The Aston Villa goalkeeper Scott Carson has been given the nod to start in England's crucial Euro 2008 qualifier against Croatia tomorrow, a source close to the camp has told Guardian Unlimited. Carson, who only made his full international debut against Austria last Friday, will replace Paul Robinson, whose error-strewn performances for Spurs and England this season seem to have robbed him of both his confidence and his judgement. Steve McClaren has consistently backed Robinson in public, but it is understood that he decided to go with Carson following a series of mistakes by the Spurs keeper in training yesterday. Despite Robinson's recent poor form, the decision to go with Carson - which won't be confirmed until an hour before kick-off - still ranks as a minor surprise, with Robinson having played every minute of the qualifying campaign. At a press conference earlier today, McClaren refused to give any clue as to the composition of his line-up, but when asked if he understood the concern around Robinson, he replied with a curt ""yep"". McClaren, who has named Steven Gerrard as his captain, revealed that he had already picked his team, but would not inform the players until later this evening. ""The players may think they have an idea, but they won't know the team until it goes up on the board at 6.30pm tonight,"" he insisted. John Terry, who has been sidelined since damaging his knee in training on the day before England's defeat in Russia, took part in training with the squad this morning but won't be considered for tomorrow's match. With Rio Ferdinand also out injured, Sol Campbell and Joleon Lescott are likely to continue as a makeshift partnership in the centre of defence. McClaren also spoke of his determination to take full advantage of the reprieve granted to England by Israel's shock win over Russia on Saturday. A draw would be enough for England to progress, though a 2-0 victory would enable them to leapfrog Croatia to the top of the group. ""It will be results-orientated, of course,"" said McClaren, ""but results only come from performances so we're concentrating on putting in a big performance. ""The campaign is over 12 games and those game are not over yet. It's not done and dusted, we know we have a difficult job to do because Croatia are a good team, but we were always confident it would come down to the 12th game, it has done. Now we have to finish the job and I know we have the players to do that. They're big players, who play in big games week in, week out, and now is the time to deliver."" Gerrard struck a similar note. ""It was difficult at the weekend watching other teams and hoping results would go our way,"" he admitted. ""But as soon as we knew it was back in our hands, we were 100% focused on doing the match against Croatia. We've got a lot of big players in this time. I've played in some majestic games for Liverpool and a lot of the other players have played in big games too, so we need to bring out the spirit from past big performances to beat Croatia, who are a quality side."" Gerrard claimed that if England do reach the finals, England could mount a strong challenge for the trophy. ""I certainly feel we could make a big impact,"" he said. ""That's why it was so frustrating when it was out of our hands, because I knew we could be sitting at home watching the tournament while knowing we had the players to do well there."" McClaren echoed that sentiment, adding: ""Tomorrow night is a big game but our aim is to qualify and then expand beyond that. We want to be playing in more and more big games. The first six months were difficult for various reasons but I think that during the second half of the campaign, game we've really stepped forward - myself, the staff, the players and a squad, and I think performances have shown that, except for a 10-minute spell against Russia. We're a strong team."""	Football
3899	3900	Ravel Morrison is the teenager Manchester United struggle to control 	"he last time I saw Ravel Morrison he was in the dock at Salford magistrates' court, fiddling with his tie and waiting to hear whether he was going to be locked up. An argument with his girlfriend had got out of hand, her phone had been smashed and he had ended up back in court a few months after being told the next time he was in trouble he would be going to Strangeways. Nobody from Manchester United was with him that day and it struck me as strange given the way the club usually operate. might ordinarily have been expected to make an appearance, or at least send in a character reference. But Morrison was alone, bar his solicitor. He was already on a referral order after pleading guilty to witness intimidation and the district judge had told him she would personally see to it that he went down if he re-offended. Instead, Morrison walked free, and straight back into the muddled life that has now brought us to the point, with jarring inevitability, when Ferguson has decided enough is enough and it is time to wash his hands of him. At United they will tell you that, goodness knows, they have tried everything. Or, at least, until the past few weeks when the secretary, John Alexander, rang his agent to tell him he should look for another club. By that point, one of the coaches had simply stopped talking to Morrison. His mother went to pick him up from training one day and was told, in the bluntest terms, that her son was a waste of time and not worth the hassle. Things have turned nasty and someone is spinning the truth, given that Ferguson said it was about money and the ""unrealistic"" demands of a player who has not yet turned 19. Morrison says he has never been offered a contract or asked for a pay rise, defending himself on Twitter where he announced during last season's player of the year dinner that the event was ""shit"". His first-team career at United amounts to three Carling Cup substitute appearances and it is terribly sad when behind the scenes they talk of him being as naturally gifted as Paul Scholes. Barcelona have asked about him. Chelsea and Arsenal have thought long and hard about whether they can get him under control. Their verdict is they probably cannot, which leaves Newcastle, Roma and Paris St-Germain among the potential buyers. It may be the best piece of business they ever do, or may be their worst nightmare. With Morrison, it is better not to take anything for granted. On the football pitch, he plays with finesse and confidence. In court, he was described as vulnerable and fragile. The picture that emerged was of someone who acts compulsively and does not think of the consequences. The referral order was imposed after he tried to intimidate the 15-year-old victim of a street robbery out of giving evidence. Morrison never seemed to understand the seriousness of sending threatening messages, then being part of the mob that chased the robbery victim and threw a brick through his window. The boy did. He was so traumatised his family put their house up for sale. The people closest to Morrison say some of his misdemeanours, such as once giving a first-team player's boots to a friend, are simply to please others. Items often go missing from dressing rooms and in Sir Matt Busby's time they used marked money to trap the player responsible. These days Twitter hears everything, true and false. Now we have the sideshow of Morrison tweeting Rio Ferdinand to ask for back-up after rumours about him stealing his watch. Ferdinand confirmed it was untrue. This is meets . The best advice Ferdinand could offer Morrison would be to delete his account. Except Morrison does not like being told what to do. He is not seduced by United in the way most teenage boys would be. He has grown bored of being with the reserves, listening to the shouts from the first-team players on the next field. Lesser players have moved up, which he has found hard to take. Ferguson told him he would be, too – but only if he managed three months without skipping a session. Morrison does not work that way. His life at United has become a story of no-shows, stand-up rows and other disciplinary matters. Outside the club, 999 has been called more than once. ""Write what you want about him,"" said one member of training-ground staff, expletives removed. What United would rather not come out is that, in court, the district judge questioned whether the club were giving him the right care. Her view was that they may not be. Equally, if it is true this is not about money it reflects badly on Ferguson, to say the least, that he should say otherwise. Morrison, who is willing to move abroad, says he has ""never asked for money and never rejected anything"". Whatever the truth, there are no winners in this story. This could be a £40m footballer in a few years, if only life were so simple. Instead you just hope that there never comes a day when he is that bloke in the pub telling anyone who cares to listen that it should have been him."	Football
10521	10522	Why Manchester United's class of 92 are natural choice to hold the fort 	"It was when Ben Turner, one of the directors who helped make , told Ryan Giggs that he is a Sunderland fan that he realised what made great. ""Most people laugh at me,"" Turner says. But not Giggs. United's new manager was having a flashback to something terrible instead. ""He looked at us, no joke, and went: 'I seem to remember you beating us in 1997,'"" says Turner, who directed the film alongside his brother, Gabe. ""He remembered the one time we'd beaten them. That stuck in his mind. It was very much that sense of when you're on the beach, you think about the trophy you didn't win and, when you win it, you celebrate and move on. We were talking about the game. John Mullin scored the winning goal. I don't think he ever did anything else in a Sunderland shirt. But Giggs remembered the time he'd lost to us."" For Giggs, and the other members of that generation – Nicky Butt, David Beckham, the Neville brothers and Paul Scholes – losing was not an option. The film explores how these six boys came to dominate English football, and that conversation about a defeat in 1997 hammered home to Turner that it was an insatiable desire for victory that set them apart. It is why United turned to the class of '92 until the end of the season after David Moyes was sacked. Giggs and his assistants, Butt, Phil Neville and Scholes, have the club in their blood. ""We spoke to Giggs, to congratulate him, and he said he didn't bat an eyelid when he was asked if he wanted the job,"" Turner says. ""He'd accepted it before they'd even finished asking him. They buy into the story of Manchester United."" Turner is not surprised that Giggs, the leader of the pack, is now the manager. ""If they were ever going to do it there was an unsaid feeling that he is the leader of the group, but they all wanted to be involved at United,"" he says. ""I mean, they managed to talk Scholes out of retirement and he's back now. He answered the call so quickly. But it's not a surprise that Giggs would be the manager. ""They all have a lot of respect for him because he broke through first and he was the gold standard for them. I think they all look up to him."" Turner believes that success has not changed them as people. ""They are very down-to-earth,"" he says. There is an aura to them, but also a sense of camaraderie – normal people whose childhood dream came true. ""They were like any group of old mates who'd been on an amazing adventure together. But they're very affectionate towards each other. They're very protective of each other and have a lot of respect. It seemed like a really balanced group of people, without any regrets. I don't know if they see each other all the time now, but they were very familiar instantly."" Turner admits he was worried about Scholes being too shy for the camera – fears that were soon allayed – while he remains hugely impressed with Butt. ""He was great,"" he says. ""People don't know him as much as the others, but he was one of the leaders when they were coming through and sort of looked after them. The leadership qualities and the status he has was a nice surprise."" A walk around Old Trafford brought home to Turner that he was in the company of living legends. ""It was very soon after they'd all kind of retired. There's a part of the museum at the ground about the class of '92 and I felt it was like watching them pass into mythology. ""I was looking at the statue of Best, Law and Charlton as they were walking past it, and their achievements have eclipsed what those guys did. They're as big a legend as you can possibly be at that club. And as time goes by, their mythology will grow because when you don't see them play every week, the story grows."""	Football
1902	1903	12 Years a Slave overcomes tough subject matter to top UK box office 	With Oscar nominations announced this Thursday, the annual awards season is now in full swing, presenting the perfect opportunity for a potentially challenging adult drama – Steve McQueen's – to engage cinema audiences. And so it proved, with a very healthy £2.51m opening for the gritty true story from just 207 cinemas, delivering a site average of £12,132. Local distributor eOne was quick to trumpet this achievement as bigger than the UK opening of (£1.83m from 324 cinemas), and with a higher screen average than the debut of (£8,919). Both those titles were massive feel-good crowdpleasers that went on to achieve enormous multiples of their opening numbers. Although 12 Years a Slave does ultimately cohere to the triumph-over-adversity template, there is perhaps more in the way of adversity and less of triumph than some of the broader audiences that embraced Danny Boyle and Tom Hooper's Oscar-winners may prefer. In any case, it's certainly a very strong start for a film with tough subject matter from a director whose previous pictures ( , ) were both resolutely art-house fare. Shame opened exactly two years ago with £542,000 from 114 cinemas. Hunger kicked off in October 2008 with £136,000 from 68 venues. The arrival of 12 Years a Slave pushes down to second place, but with a decline from the previous weekend of just 18%. After 12 days of wide release, David O Russell's latest has grossed an impressive £6.78m, which compares with £2.71m for at the same stage of its run. The earlier Russell film went on to reach £5.3m over the course of a marathon six-month theatrical session, and a similar trajectory would see American Hustle max out around £13m. After winning the Golden Globe for best comedy/musical on Sunday and picking up 10 Bafta nominations last week, the film would appear to have a sustained run within its grasp. For the second weekend in a row, at least seven films have taken £1m-plus at the UK box-office, with and both still in the top five after a respective five and six weeks of play. Frozen has achieved six consecutive weekends over £1m – in 2013, only and (both of which reached more than £40m in total) managed that feat. With £32.8m so far, Frozen is the second-biggest-grossing film from Walt Disney Animation (as opposed to Disney-owned Pixar), exceeded only by The Lion King, which grossed £23.14m with its original 2D release, and then added £12.36m with the 2011 3D rerelease for a £35.5m total. The Hobbit sequel's tally of £40.1m compares unfavourably with its £48.5m at the same stage of its run. On the positive side, it will very soon overtake Les Miserables (£40.8m) to become the second-biggest 2013 release, behind only Despicable Me 2 (£47.4m). Considering the enduring power of so many titles in the market, distributors Lionsgate and eOne will be pleased that their respective mid-ranking new releases – and – landed with a decent £1.2m and £1.1m. The happy result for the former will be a surprise for some. Each year, the January-February awards corridor sees a too-crowded field lead to inevitable casualties, as nominations fail to materialise for a number of contenders. The Railway Man may have dangled itself for the consideration of awards voters, but their attentions so far have gone in other directions, and box-office might have followed the path of last year's also-rans such as and . Clearly the premise and cast – including Colin Firth and Nicole Kidman – have proved much more enticing to the target audience. And given the film's appeal to the older demographic, should enjoy strong weekday box-office, and end the week higher than the sixth place achieved at the weekend. Back in Imax cinemas across the UK, saw its box-office rise by 31%, with Imax contributing £123,000 of the £334,000 weekend takings. The renewed activity follows 11 Bafta nominations for the Alfonso Cuarón space drama. Gravity has now pushed past £28m, and is inching towards distributor Warner's top 2013 title, (£29.95m). Admissions figures for 2013 are now in, and with 165.5m tickets sold, numbers are 4% down on 2012. Admissions are also down on the levels achieved in the years 2009-2011, but are up on 2005-2008. It would appear that the boost provided by 3D over the previous four years has now dissipated. More positively, UK cinema admissions remain triple the low point of the mid-1980s, when they dipped to 54m. And in fairness 2012, which saw become the first film to gross £100m at UK cinemas, was always going to be a tough act to follow. After a strong run where box-office was up, level or only slightly down on the year-ago equivalent weekend, the latest frame has seen a big dip vs 2013. The reason is simple: exactly a year ago, Les Miserables landed at cinemas, and 12 Years a Slave was never going to match it. Overall, the market is 30% down on the same period a year ago. Cinema owners now have their hopes pinned on a strong hold for existing titles, plus the arrival of Martin Scorsese's , which has already notched up $78m in the US.

12108	12109	The Avengers powers to US box office record 	"Hollywood's latest adaptation from the world of comics, , has smashed the box office record for the biggest US opening weekend by a margin befitting a film trading heavily on cacophonous superhero-style walloping. The $200.3m (£124m) debut is by far the biggest American opening to date, shooting past the $169.2m record for the debut of last year's Harry Potter finale. A $200m take from all new movies is considered a great weekend for the business as a whole, so The Avengers has effectively redefined the standards for a blockbuster debut. ""If The Avengers is any indication, we're going to see a leap rather than a gentle little nudge into new territory, and the lineup is there to justify it going forward,"" said Greg Foster, chairman and president of the Imax cinema chain. The film – renamed Avengers Assemble for the UK and Irish market, to avoid confusion with the vintage TV series – . Crowds in the US were so anxious to see the film on giant Imax screens that Foster said the company had only one problem: it ran out of seats to sell. The record weekend was the culmination of years of careful planning by Marvel Studios, which has included teasers for an Avengers dream team collaboration in its solo superhero adventures. Directed by (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), The Avengers features Robert Downey Jnr as Iron Man, Chris Evans as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury. The Avengers added $151.5m outside the US over the weekend. That raised the film's worldwide haul to $641.8m in barely a week and a half, more than its Marvel superhero forerunners, Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America, took during their entire runs. When the final US weekend count is released on Monday, The Avengers will be the first movie to haul in $200m in a single weekend in the US if the estimates currently being put out by distributor Disney hold up. The Avengers is the first of three superhero blockbusters coming this summer: The Amazing Spider-Man is released on 3 July and The Dark Knight Rises wraps up the current Batman series on 20 July. Until the Harry Potter finale, 2008's The Dark Knight had held the revenue record with a $158.4m debut. Before that, the record-holder was 2007's Spider-Man 3 with $151.1m. As admission prices rise, Hollywood's record-breakers often take in more money but sell fewer tickets than previous blockbusters. But The Avengers took in so much money that it has become the undisputed champion among debuts."	Film
9209	9210	Ken Russell: Sex, nuns and rock'n'roll 	"I worked with Ken on six films. was the first time I'd worked with a director of that genius, and on a film of that size. What I remember most was the creative and productive atmosphere on set: he was open to ideas from everyone, from the clapperboard operator upwards. Like any great director, he knew what he didn't want – but was open to everything else. As a director he never said anything very specific. He'd say, ""It needs to be a bit more … , or a bit less "", and you knew exactly what he meant. I used to ask him why he never said ""Cut"", and he said, ""Because it means you always do something different."" They gave me an Oscar [for her performance as Gudrun Brangwen], but as I was working. I haven't seen the film since the initial screening for cast and crew. Working with Ken was one of the great joys of my life. My whole memory of him is infused with laughter. His imagination grew and developed over the course of the films we made together [ , , , , ]. I think it's a great disgrace to the film industry that he has been ignored for so long, that people have not respected the barriers he broke down. The last film I worked with him on was about the composer , in which he played Bax. He was so frightened as a performer, very nervous. He cast himself in his films because nobody was giving him enough to do. We were great friends, and I treasure that very much. We used to call him Cuddly Ken. He wasn't this wild director, merely out to shock and discomfort people. This idea that he was some kind of voyeur could not be further from the truth. He was passionately devoted to the screen, and passionate about social justice. Where did he stand politically? I wouldn't know: we never talked about it. But he was one of the two great directors in my life time – Ken, and in the theatre, . Without Ken, I would not have had my career. He was both extraordinary and impossible. He was always absolutely immersed in the world of the film he was working on, and he expected the same commitment of everyone: if he thought you weren't up to scratch, he would order you off the set. With Ken, everything was immediate: he'd suddenly come up with an idea, and want to get on with it there and then. I loved working that way. He was also very trusting. When we worked on [the 1974 film in which Powell played the composer], we spent two and a half weeks filming in the Lake District, without being able to view the daily rushes. That meant we were working pretty much blind – but he trusted me, the other actors and the editor completely. The editor later said he was worried I wasn't sympathetic enough on screen; Ken kept that from me for a long time. He could be immensely funny. He once told me that he'd been invited to address a drama school on the subject of film acting. ""Why don't you come with me, Robert?"" he said. ""We'll take a stepladder, a bucket of water, a bucket of leaves and dirt and filth, and a wind machine. We'll put an actor on the ladder, and throw everything at them: then they'll understand how difficult it is."" That made me laugh: in one scene in Mahler, I had been required to stand on a stepladder, with an electrician holding me up by keeping a large hand on my bottom. I met Ken on [BBC arts programme] , where he was the star turn. He had just done , which had expanded people's appreciation of what an arts programme could do. It was bookended by two glorious shots: one of a boy riding a white horse across the Malvern Hills; another of men with bandages over their eyes, stumbling across the detritus of war, with Land of Hope and Glory playing in the background. It was shattering. It was also an area of arts programming that hadn't been explored before, using fiction to make a documentary, and it caused a hell of a row. I was 24 when we worked together on , and it wasn't done to say: ""This actor, Oliver Reed, will play Debussy."" People said we were degrading expectations of what BBC documentaries should be. Ken didn't go to university, but he knew more about film than anyone else. At Oxford, I'd been the film critic on the university newspaper; when I met him, Ken was this innocent Friar Tuck character who had seen every film ever made. Thank goodness gave him a job at Monitor. Ken scarcely spoke in those days; he was just waiting to get hold of a camera. I wrote the screenplay for , and we made a dozen or so documentaries for the . For the last 15 years of his life, I was his major commissioning editor. The critics had rather lost interest in him by then. He didn't get the backing of a Hollywood studio, or a British funding body, and so was slightly abandoned – a difficult place to be. But he was fearless, eccentric and silly; I liked the first two and excused the last. Nobody else played with music and imagery the way he did; in Tommy, he cracked the rock world, and it's a very powerful piece of film-making. Ken didn't lack for boldness. I liked him a lot. He was a genius of cinema, an iconoclast. I am so proud that for him. His brilliant choice of as his set designer is a ""for instance"" of that genius. It's strange to think that the Vatican banned this film; it's also weird that in the UK we still had film and theatre censorship. I'll always remember Savage Messiah, and likewise The Music Lovers, with Glenda Jackson and an amazing script, photography and cast. He directed in 1992 for the BBC, and there were more than 15 million viewers. My daughter played Lady Chatterley. We will both be for ever grateful to Ken for his thoughtful and loving obituary of our . She played Mary Shelley in Ken's Gothic. I hope the BBC will rerun the brilliant black-and-white films Ken directed about some of the world's famous composers; this would be a great and deserved tribute. Ken was that very rare thing: a film director who actually loved, understood and respected music, and who took his relationship with a composer very seriously. I composed the music for two of his films: and The Boy Friend. Ken had heard my piece and liked it; the call asking me to work on The Devils came out of the blue. I had never done anything like it, and I will always be grateful to him for asking me. His approach to film-making was very similar to that of a musician: his films evolved in long musical sentences, with moments of high tension followed by moments of relaxation. He certainly understood the importance of the score: I would sometimes say to him that I didn't feel a particular piece of music had been given enough time to breathe, and request another half-minute of footage. He would say, ""Let me think about it,"" and then come back and say yes. That's almost unheard of. He showed an irreverence for the lives of the great composers that sometimes came in for criticism. I believe [Dance of the Seven Veils] – which featured a scene in which Hitler danced around with Strauss on his shoulders, playing the violin – had questions asked about it in parliament. But what I admired about Ken was that he always had immense confidence in his vision, even when it got him into trouble. He was capable of being both Vermeer and Benny Hill. With Women in Love – which I still think is one of the greatest British films of all time – he was the former: he had this wonderful, painterly eye. So when I was cast in one of his films - I played Lord Alfred Douglas and John the Baptist in [the 1988 film] Salome's Last Dance – I went with high expectations. Unfortunately, this was one of his Benny Hill phases. It might well be the worst film he ever made. On my very first day on set, I was handed a leather string and told this was my entire costume. I was only 25, so I didn't complain. Nor did I complain when the makeup people told me that Ken wanted my entire body painted green. So they spent ages painting me, and then I went out into the freezing-cold lot, and Ken shouted: ""Not that green!"" All day I went back and forth between makeup and the set, until finally Ken was happy with the colour. By then everyone else had left, so I just put my clothes on and went home, thinking, ""God, I've got to be back here getting painted green again at 5am."" I saw Ken a few more times after that; at the premiere of Salome, all the cinema ushers were topless. He was both sublime and ridiculous; both qualities lived in him simultaneously. In his later years, Ken was hugely marginalised by the film industry – they were afraid of him, I think. They shouldn't have been: he could be difficult, yes, but what great artist isn't? And he was incredibly collaborative, as I discovered when I worked with him. Getting to work with Ken was a real watershed moment: I'd worshipped him from afar for years, ever since seeing his films about Elgar and . The way he paired music and images was a revelation. When I saw him on TV being berated by [the Evening Standard film critic] , and then standing up and hitting Walker over the head with a rolled-up copy of the Standard, I thought, ""This is a man I love."" We eventually worked together on a couple of scripts that never came to fruition, and on , a compilation-movie I made consisting of operatic pieces directed by some of the world's greatest directors. When he heard I was doing it, Ken called me up and asked to direct Nessun Dorma. I told him to go ahead, and he sent me a two-page handwritten letter explaining exactly how he would make the film. ""I can't go ahead just with this,"" I said, but we did. Ken was wonderful on set: methodical and committed. He never shouted at anyone, and he drank a glass of champagne at 6pm every day. Twenty-four hours after we'd finished shooting, he had the film edited and ready; every scene was exactly as he had described it in that two-page letter. He always knew exactly what he was doing; that was the source of his genius. "	Film
10172	10173	Spread of Lord Brittan child abuse dossier allegations is ‘wicked’ 	The behaviour of MPs spreading “innuendos and insinuations” about the late Lord Brittan has been condemned as “wicked” by a former cabinet colleague. Lord Deben, better known as John Gummer, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that suggestions Brittan was involved in covering up allegations about child abuse involving prominent figures when he was home secretary in the 1980s were “obviously not true … anybody who knew him, knew that that was not the nature of the man”. He said: “Anybody who doesn’t have real evidence should recognise that it is a wicked thing to do to make allegations about anybody, even if you don’t like their politics.” After the , many political figures have paid tribute to the man who was one of the leading figures in Margaret Thatcher’s government and went on to become vice-president of the European commission after resigning from the cabinet over the Westland affair. But, in the final year of his life, Brittan was dogged by allegations that, as home secretary, he failed to properly investigate allegations of child abuse that were given to him in a dossier by the late Geoffrey Dickens, a Tory MP at the time. Simon Danczuk, a Labour MP and a leading campaigner against child abuse, said Brittan’s death was a loss not just for his family, but for victims hoping to get to the bottom of what happened in the 1980s. “Sir Leon’s untimely death is a loss to the inquiry that the home secretary ordered into establishment child abuse,” Danczuk said. “Sir Leon is someone who should have faced questions and been compelled to give evidence to the inquiry over his role as home secretary in the 1980s when a dossier containing allegations of establishment child abuse was handed to him.” Alison Millar, of the law firm Leigh Day which is representing abuse victims, said her clients would be disappointed that Brittan could not now tell the inquiry what he knew about the allegations. Brittan issued a statement last year saying he asked Home Office officials to look carefully at the allegations and to take appropriate action. But that did little to quell suspicions amongst campaigners that some sort of cover-up took place. An inquiry into what happened to the Dickens allegations found that many potentially relevant files were missing. Other allegations against Brittan were even more serious. In October last year the Labour MP Jim Hood used parliamentary privilege during a debate on coalfield communities to say that there were rumours about Brittan being involved in “improper conduct with children”. Hood offered no evidence to support his claim, which outraged Conservative MPs, and it was not widely reported. Brittan was questioned last year over a . The woman was over 18 at the time of the alleged incident. It is understood Brittan strongly denied the allegation. The Metropolitan police said at the time: “A man aged in his seventies was interviewed under caution by appointment at a central London location in connection with the allegation. He was not arrested.” In his Today interview, Deben said politicians should show more responsibility when it came to airing unsubstantiated rumours. “One of the things that social media demands of us – and I use it a lot myself – is a sense of personal responsibility, and I do think that, particularly politicians, making innuendos and insinuations in order to make themselves look as if they know something when they don’t, should shut up,” he said. “If they do know something, they should come forward directly and give that information, but passing on innuendos is actually wrong.” Deben said he was pleased to hear a BBC journalist question the suggestion that the information presented by Dickens about abuse allegations amounted to a “dossier”. The idea that Dickens was the sort of MP who would produce a well thought-out and properly researched dossier was “not terribly likely”, he added. Deben also described Brittan as “probably the most successful [European] commissioner we have had”. In a statement on Thursday, Brittan’s family said he had been ill with cancer for some time. “As a family, we should like to pay tribute to him as a beloved husband to Diana and brother to Samuel, and a supportive and loving stepfather to Katharine and Victoria, and step-grandfather to their children. “We also salute his extraordinary commitment to British public life as a member of parliament, minister, cabinet minister, European commissioner and peer – together with a distinguished career in law, and latterly in business … We shall miss him enormously.” David Cameron said Brittan was a “dedicated and fiercely intelligent public servant”. “As a central figure in Margaret Thatcher’s government, he helped her transform our country for the better by giving distinguished service,” the prime minister said. “He went on to play a leading role at the European commission where he did so much to promote free trade in Europe and across the world. More recently, he made an active contribution to the House of Lords.” The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, said Brittan’s death was “sad news”. William Hague, leader of the Commons, told parliament on Thursday: “He was, as the house will understand, my predecessor as member of parliament for Richmond in Yorkshire, which is why I particularly want to pay tribute to him as a former member of this house and former home secretary, and he was a kind, assiduous and brilliant man and I know the whole house will join me in sending our deepest condolences to his wife, Diana, at this difficult time.”	Politics
10816	10817	IMF says economic growth may never return to pre-crisis levels 	The has cut its global growth forecasts for 2014 and 2015 and warned that the world economy may never return to the pace of expansion seen before the financial crisis. In its flagship half-yearly world economic outlook (WEO), the IMF said the failure of countries to recover strongly from the worst recession of the postwar era meant there was a risk of stagnation or persistently weak activity. The IMF said it expected global growth to be 3.3% in 2014, and 0.1 points down on interim forecasts made in July. A pick-up in the rate of expansion to 3.8% is forecast for 2015, down from 3.9% in the April WEO and 4% in July. But the IMF highlighted the risk that its predictions would once again be too optimistic. “The pace of global recovery has disappointed in recent years”, the IMF said, noting that since 2010 it had been consistently forced to revise down its forecasts. “With weaker-than-expected global growth for the first half of 2014 and increased downside risks, the projected pickup in growth may again fail to materialise or fall short of expectation.” The IMF’s economic counsellor, Olivier Blanchard, said the three main short-term risks were that financial markets were too complacent about the future; tensions between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East; and that a triple-dip recession in the eurozone could lead to deflation. Although the IMF believes the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England will be the first two major central banks to start raising interest rates by the middle of 2015, it advised that official borrowing costs should be kept low so long as demand remained weak. It added that countries with healthy public finances, such as Germany, should spend more on infrastructure in order to boost growth and cautioned against over-aggressive attempts to reduce budget deficits. From a medium-term perspective, low potential output growth and “secular stagnation” are still important risks, given that robust demand growth has not yet emerged. “In particular, despite continued very low interest rates and increased risk appetite in financial markets, a pick-up in investment has not yet materialised, possibly reflecting concerns about low medium-term potential growth rates and subdued private consumption (in a context of weak growth in median incomes).” Japan and the euro area were most at risk of stagnation, the WEO said. “In such a situation, some affected countries would not be able to generate the demand needed to restore full employment through regular self-correcting forces.” The IMF said the outlook was brighter in the US and the UK, which were “leaving the crisis behind and achieving decent growth”. Britain is forecast to see its gross domestic product increase by 3.2% in 2014 – up 0.3 points from the April WEO and the fastest of any G7 nation. America’s slow start to 2014 means, according to the IMF, that it will expand by 2.2% this year, rising to 3.1% in 2015 – faster than Britain’s 2.7%. Blanchard said, however, that even in the two biggest Anglo-Saxon economies potential growth rates were lower than in the early 2000s. Euro area growth is predicted to be 0.8% in 2014, rising to 1.3% next year. Japan’s high level of public debt and ageing population mean it will grow by less than 1% in both years, the IMF said. Blanchard said there was a possibility that ultra-low growth in the euro area could turn into deflation, a period of falling prices that would make debts more expensive to service. “This is not our baseline (forecast), because we believe euro area fundamentals are slowing improving. But should such a scenario play out, it would be the major issue confronting the global economy.” The IMF said the slowdown in growth was affecting not just the west but also emerging markets such as China, Russia and Brazil.

12070	12071	Steven Gerrard won't let World Cup focus slip, says Brendan Rodgers 	" is his own worst critic but will not allow the disappointment of Liverpool's title slip to affect his World Cup, according to Brendan Rodgers. The Liverpool manager believes England's captain should have greater confidence in Brazil following the closest title challenge of his career. The 33-year-old admitted he was ""absolutely devastated"" to miss out on a first Premier League winner's medal having helped guide to a six-point lead over Manchester City with three matches to go. Opposition supporters have taunted Gerrard for his mis-control and slip against Chelsea, when Demba Ba raced through to open the scoring at Anfield, and his body language after the final game of the season against Newcastle United spoke of anguish at an otherwise resurgent campaign. Gerrard has been ""very hard on himself"", says Rodgers, but the Liverpool manager does not believe England's campaign will be hindered by introspection from the midfielder. He has reiterated that porous defending cost Liverpool the Premier League crown, not individual error. ""I have no concerns whatsoever,"" said Rodgers, who has made Chelsea's Ryan Bertrand his top left-back target for the summer and is interested in Southampton's central defender Dejan Lovren and Bayern Munich winger Xherdan Shaqiri. He is also an admirer of Swansea City striker Wilfried Bony. ""I think Steven will go away and reflect on what has been personally a brilliant season of football. ""He has been very unfairly pointed out in terms of his slip. It could have happened in the third game, it could have happened in the fourth game but it certainly wasn't anywhere near the defining moment of our season. That wasn't what cost us the league. It was more games when we won. When we won 5-3 at Stoke when we conceded, when we won 6-3 at Cardiff, when we won 4-3 at home against Swansea, another three conceded. It was those games, not Steven's slip or Kolo's misplaced pass [Touré at West Bromwich Albion]. ""He is a very conscientious boy, he loves Liverpool and he is very hard on himself. Steven is his own worst critic but he will go away recognising that he has been involved in a real title run-in and next season he will be better for it and we will be a better squad for it. We will be ready to fight again and he will play a pivotal part in it. He will take that confidence into the World Cup."" The World Cup could prove to be Gerrard's final tournament with , although no decision has been made on his international future, and Rodgers is convinced his captain will forget his disappointment at club level once Roy Hodgson's squad convene. He added: ""I always say to players 'when you go to England don't think of Liverpool. Think about your country and the team you are playing for'. One of his qualities is that he can do that. He is a model professional at that, he is very proud to play for England and captain his country, and I am sure he will go and do the country proud again."""	Football
8169	8170	Almost 10,000 Lloyds staff to receive back pay over denied pay rises 	Almost 10,000 current and former employees of – the vast majority of whom are women – are each to receive hundreds of pounds in back pay after the bank denied them pay rises. The staff are to be handed the payments after a long-running dispute between the bank and the LTU union over contracts that staff were asked to sign after the rescue of HBOS in 2008. The contracts did not specify the hours that staff would be required to work which, the LTU said, had an adverse impact on women, particularly those working part-time with caring responsibilities. “These are not Libor-rigging investment bankers but women trying to do the best for their families. They deserved better from Lloyds Group,” said Mark Brown, general secretary of the LTU. Refusal to sign the contract meant that staff were denied annual pay increases in 2011 and received only partial ones in 2012, the LTU said. The payments are thought to average around £500 each. Among the 10,000 are around 2,000 employees who now work for TSB, the high street bank in which Lloyds still owns a 50% stake. Most of the staff work in branches. Women make up 65% of Lloyds’ workforce and the proportion of women who did not sign was 78% while 55% of those who did not sign were part-time employees compared to 20% of full-time staff. Lloyds is making the payment after a decision a year ago by an employment tribunal in a case brought by three female staff. “While the tribunal decision applied only to three colleagues, we have decided to review the pay of all current colleagues who did not originally sign our harmonised terms and conditions in 2010. Where this shows an individual would have been entitled to a pay increase in 2011 and 2012, we will make the appropriate adjustment to pay and pensionable pay,” a spokesman for Lloyds said. Brown said that Lloyds knew the policy of asking staff to sign the contracts would have a disproportionate effect on part-time female employees. “And despite knowing the impact of its policy on relatively low-paid women, the group went ahead anyway, hoping that its discriminatory actions wouldn’t be challenged. Well, they were challenged and the bank has now had to pay out millions in compensation to low-paid women the length and breadth of the country,” Brown said. Members of other unions at Lloyds – including Accord which largely represents HBOS employees – agreed to terms with the bank two years ago. The bank is in the process of cutting another 9,000 staff after axing 45,000 roles since the rescue of HBOS in 2008. The first tranche of those 9,000 cuts was announced last week when Lloyds told staff that 1,250 jobs were to go.	Business
6308	6309	Manchester United eye £12m move for Dnipro winger Yevhen Konoplyanka 	Louis van Gaal is considering paying Yevhen Konoplyanka’s €15m (£12.1m) buyout clause, with the Dnipro winger willing to join despite them not qualifying for next season’s Champions League. United have scouted Konoplyanka, who is also interesting Liverpool and Schalke, on more than one occasion, the most recent being on Sunday when Dnipro played Metalurh Donetsk. Andrey Stetsenko, Dnipro’s sporting director who is in charge of transfers, accepts that Konoplyanka could leave the club, with United moving ahead of Liverpool as the Merseyside club have not been in contact since January. “Our scouts are working to find his replacement. Sooner or later Konoplyanka will leave Dnipro,” he said. “We know that English, Spanish and German clubs are monitoring the situation and are interested in the player. But we have had no offers. His contract has a buyout clause worth €15m for foreign clubs. For Ukrainian clubs the buyout is more. “Konoplyanka spoke to me and said that if he did not have offers from foreign clubs in the future it would not be a problem. He would stay with us with pleasure and continue to play for Dnipro.” While United and Schalke scouts were at Sunday’s game, with Dnipro officials having ensured they were accommodated, it is understood that Liverpool retain an interest, though Stetsenko said that since the winter transfer window, the interest from Brendan Rodgers has cooled. “After negotiations in the winter Liverpool did not contact us further about Konoplyanka,” he said. While the Merseyside club have the attraction of Champions League football if they were to firm up their interest, Konoplyanka would be minded to sign for United if Van Gaal moves for him. The winger, who impressed for during Euro 2012, is wanted by Van Gaal as he looks to overhaul his wide options, as Ashley Young, Antonio Valencia and Nani have all consistently disappointed. One player who will not be joining United this summer, despite talk of a move, is Toni Kroos. that Van Gaal had decided against pursuing the Bayern Munich midfielder, who said on Friday that he expects to stay at the German champions. Kroos has long been linked with a move to Old Trafford but the 24-year-old is no longer a target for United and has now confirmed that he thinks he will stay at the German champions. “I am expecting to play for Bayern Munich next season,” Kroos told Bild. “There was a lot of speculation, but Manchester is and was not an issue. At this point in time I am fully focused on preparations for the 2014 Fifa World Cup.” Kroos has a year left with Bayern and has yet to accept their offer of an extension. Rumours of a United move for Kroos circulated when David Moyes was in charge, although talk has cooled since the appointment of . Meanwhile, Patrice Evra has signed a one-year contract extension, ending speculation that he would be on his way out of the club.	Football
14597	14598	Report sets goal of more women in boardrooms of FTSE 100 firms 	More needs to be done to increase the pipeline of women being prepared for top jobs at Britain’s biggest companies, according to the authors of a government-endorsed report into diversity in the boardrooms of stockmarket-listed companies. While FTSE 100 companies are on track to achieve the goal , this has come mainly through a rise in the number of non-executive directors rather than full-time directors involved in the day-to-day running of companies. Davies is a former boss of Standard Chartered bank and former trade minister in the Labour government. Ruth Sealy, a visiting fellow at Cranfield, which published the half-yearly update on women in boardrooms on Wednesday, said: “What is most encouraging is that finally we are seeing the percentage of female executive directors starting to rise, after having stagnated at 5%-6% for many years.” Twenty-four women now hold full-time boardroom positions at 100 companies, while the overall percentage of women with boardroom seats has hit 22.8%. “Whilst we are very pleased finally to be reporting a small increase in the percentage of female executive directors, this issue still needs to be actively addressed. Longitudinal data from the female FTSE reports shows us that ignoring the status quo or believing that ‘things will get better in time’ is not the answer and drives female talent out of the door,” the report’s authors said. The report builds on the data published last month by the department of business innovation of skills even though the proportion of female directors was 22.8% when aggregating all boardroom positions across the FTSE 100. The authors set out five action points for those at the helm of listed companies, including calling for one in three new directorships to go a female candidate and for all companies to aim for 25% of their board directors to be women. Some 39 companies in the FTSE 100 currently meet this target, according to the recent BIS data. Some 24 boardroom positions need to be given to women if companies in the FTSE 100 are to achieve the overall goal in time - a position which can reached if the rate of hiring continues at its current pace. Davies urged boardroom bosses to keep up the momentum. “Although our target is in sight, we must keep up the momentum. Companies need to harness all available talent and those companies with less than 25% of women on their board need to take action now,” he said. The number of women in boardrooms has almost doubled since he set the targets in 2011 and there are no longer any all-male boards in the FTSE 100, compared with 21 when the project started. The focus is also turning to the next 250 biggest companies on the stockmarket, where 150 boardroom roles need to be filled by women to move towards the 25% target. The report said: “In order for the same target to be met by FTSE 250 companies, the pace of change still needs to increase.” There was a drop in the rate of female appointments in the FTSE 250, at 25.5% in the six months to September 2014, compared with 29.3% in the six months to September 2013. There are 28 all-male boards in the wider index. The report points out that some companies are doing relatively well, such as the mining company Anglo American – where 16% of its workforce are women but 23% in senior management and 25% representation in the boardroom.

7695	7696	A rough ride for Andrew Lansley 	"It was a crummy return to parliament for many MPs. Not least , the health secretary, whose super-duper bill that is supposed to reform the NHS has been put on hold, presumably by David Cameron. The prime minister is famous for hanging his underlings out to dry. They come up with a brilliant wheeze. He supports them vigorously right up to the point that the wheeze is criticised by someone. In this case, everyone seems to hate Mr Lansley's bill, not least the Royal College of Nursing, whose members voted almost unanimously against it this month. But the bill has now gone through most of its stages in the Commons. It's getting a bit late to change it. So Mr Lansley resembles a bungee jumper who has thrown himself off the bridge and now finds himself hurtling upwards, terrified of banging his head on the ironwork. Or, as he put it on Tuesday, many times, ""We will pause, listen and reflect."" This was greeted by loud and ribald laughter from Labour MPs. He sounded much like Loyd Grossman, whom older readers may recall used to present the original Masterchef programme, and who invariably preceded the judges' result by saying, ""We have digested, cogitated and deliberated."" In this case, many assume, ministers have decided to pause, listen and reflect, then scrape the lot into the bin. Even Lib Dem members of the coalition had serious doubts. Simon Hughes said we needed to know what changes were going to be made. ""People have very strong views,"" he said, and jeering Labour voices yelled, ""Yes! They have!"" Stephen Dorrell, a former Tory health minister, had doubts too. We had to get the views of all clinical staff, including nurses, and not just GPs. I took this to mean the government just hadn't done the spadework. But then they never do. So many of its schemes, like the plan to sell off forests, have the air of being invented by lonely schoolboys in their bedrooms. The stress test of real life has never been applied. Later it was an unsatisfactory day for John Hemming, the Lib Dem MP who wants to bust superinjunctions. He had a shiny new point of order all ready for the Speaker. He was going to use parliamentary privilege to name the guilty celebrities! Unfortunately, first there was an interminable statement on the Middle East. Mr Hemming stared angrily at every MP as they banged on and on. The Speaker asked for shorter questions. This is always a cue for MPs to talk even more. Finally Mr Hemming asked a couple of mild questions which had nothing to do with famous actors, footballers or TV presenters. The Speaker said he would have a private word with him. And that was that. A mini-superinjunction right there in front of us. Mind you, Chris Bryant heated things up by accusing News International's Rebekah Brooks of ""telling a blatant lie"" about payments to coppers. But we were more impressed by Mr Bryant's leg, which he broke playing rugby at Twickenham – a charity match. ""Two men tackled me at once,"" he said. ""Never a good idea."""	Politics
9035	9036	Google launches Fit app to take on Apple’s Heath and Samsung’s S Health 	Google is the latest tech company to enter the health and fitness game with a dedicated Google Fit app that tracks steps and plugs into wearables and other fitness apps. Google Fit is a that tracks health and fitness data using a smartphone’s built-in sensors, but like competing apps from Samsung and Apple, it can connect to third-party apps, gadgets and services. “You can also connect your favourite fitness devices and apps like Strava, Withings, Runtastic, Runkeeper and Noom Coach to Google Fit and we’ll surface all of the relevant data in one spot, giving you a clear and complete view of your fitness,” said Sabrina Ellis a director of for Google Fit, in . “No need to check one app to see your weight and another to review a run – with Google Fit, that data will all be surfaced in one, simple place.” Google’s Fit app first appeared in a very basic form built into Google’s Android Wear smartwatches such as the Motorola Moto 360, LG G Watch and Samsung Gear Live. It is capable of tracking steps, recording them through the day and giving a basic history of steps through the week, as well as heart rate for those watches equipped with heart rate sensors. Unlike Motorola’s dedicated Moto 360 heart rate sensor app, Fit requires the user to manually measure their heart rate, rather than automatically taking it throughout at the day. The Android app for smartphones, tablets and browsers allows users to review their history, set goals and track steps, heart rate and calories burnt like any number of other fitness tracking apps, including Facebook’s Moves app and Samsung’s S Health app. But Google Fit goes beyond a simple app and like Apple’s Health for its iPhone and iPad, aims to be a central data store for all fitness information pulled from third-party services. Fit will then chart runs, weight, sports, sleep and other fitness data so that it can be viewed in one place, no longer isolated in individual apps. The first batch of apps that connect to Google Fit from Strava, Withings, Runtastic, Runkeeper, Noom Coach and others are expected within weeks. Google, Apple, Samsung, LG and other big technology companies are all vying for a slice of the health and fitness market. The healthcare industry is a potentially lucrative market to exploit, worth about 10% of the economy of developed nations. In Britain, more than £100bn a year is spent on the NHS, according to the Department of Health. Google Fit was first announced by Google in June at the company’s I/O developer conference, following Apple’s announcement of its Health Kit for its World Wide Developers Conference earlier that month. Apple’s Health app launched with iOS 8.1 in September and automatically tracks steps in a similar fashion to Google’s Fit.	Technology
4581	4582	Benoît Assou-Ekotto: 'What sort of mercenary stays for seven years?' 	"enoît Assou-Ekotto first met Steve The Visionist in his early days in London. He had dropped into a barber's shop off the Tottenham High Road, looking for someone to do his shape and he liked what he saw. The full-back has stayed with Steve ever since, following him when he has moved shops. Their partnership and friendship, they guesstimate, spans six or seven years. ""The thing about Ben,"" Steve says, ""is that he is loyal. And real. Forget his hair. The thing that makes Ben famous is his realness."" Steve ought to be famous, too. Never mind the self-styled moniker, there is a charisma and largesse about the Liverpool-supporting Jamaican who, out of respect to Assou-Ekotto and his shop's proximity to White Hart Lane, also looks out for Tottenham. Steve loves to talk about football, Assou-Ekotto does not and so when the latter sits down in the chair, the conversation is one-sided. ""It's always, 'What do you think? Ronaldo or Messi?'"" Assou-Ekotto says, blowing out his cheeks and scarcely concealing the boredom. ""Or maybe, because he is a Liverpool fan, 'Torres was good' ... blah, blah, blah. I don't particularly like talking about football. I don't immerse myself in it."" As if to illustrate the point, Assou-Ekotto looks blank when Luis Suárez's biting of Branislav Ivanovic comes up. ""He did what?"" he asks. ""Il a mangé?"" If he is joking, the deadpan expression is inscrutable. ""Surely, Benoît ... come on."" But no, it is plain. He has no idea. Assou-Ekotto has never got the fuss about football and footballers. He returns to the barber's shop small talk. ""I put myself in their place,"" he says. ""Perhaps it's quite cool to have a player come in for his haircut and be able to speak about football. So I speak a little bit about it. But really, it's just 'Cut the hair'."" Assou-Ekotto always tries to see the other side. He feels compelled to mine deeper and arrive at a broader understanding. He puts himself, variously, in the shoes of his manager, André Villas-Boas, the chairman, Daniel Levy, and the rank-and-file Tottenham supporter. He is provocative and challenging of stereotypes, particularly that of the modern footballer but, at the same time, he is grounded, consistent, funny and disarmingly honest. It is part of what makes him arguably the most interesting Premier League player in London. ""During my four months out injured at the beginning of the season, I attended every game at White Hart Lane and I would sit in with the Tottenham fans but with my hoodie up so nobody could recognise me,"" Assou-Ekotto says. ""I now feel I have a better understanding of what it is to be a supporter and, for me, there are two types. ""There are the fans who pass judgment quickly, who say, from the comfort of their seats, how they would have cut the ball on the inside, swung the ball around or brought it down. It was like I was sitting with Messi, Ronaldo and Maradona. Then you have the other supporter, who understands the technical things a bit more and is patient. They are smaller in number but they do exist."" Assou-Ekotto discusses his own situation this season and the difficulties that he has faced, which stem from the injury to his left knee that ruled him out from early September and left him playing catch-up in terms of match fitness but, also, include the transition to a new manager's methods and the style of new team-mates. The left-back has found a new player to his immediate right in the shape of the summer central defensive signing Jan Vertonghen and a new midfielder in front of him, with having been moved to a more central attacking role. ""Maybe you had a little head movement that you used to do with a guy,"" Assou-Ekotto says. ""You have to find these things again. It's new partnerships, maybe new languages and it takes some time."" The bottom line is that there is no spell to accelerate the re-assimilation of a player in the second-half of a season. If there were, Assou-Ekotto might have been spared the insistent speculation about his future. Since his return to first-team contention in January, he has started 12 of the club's 21 matches and the related theory goes that Villas-Boas does not rate him sufficiently and is open to selling him. There have also been rumours that Assou-Ekotto's preference to avoid knee surgery in favour of a longer, more thorough rehabilitation programme was badly received and, even, that he has clashed with Villas-Boas. Assou-Ekotto confronts each notion and dismantles it. ""The manager recommended the specialist that I went to see in Barcelona,"" he says. ""And when the specialist recommended the programme to strengthen the muscle around the knee, rather than go for the quick-fix operation, the manager and the chairman were fully supportive of the decision. ""With AVB, if I had a problem with him, I would tell you immediately. If I don't like the guy, I would tell you: ""I don't like the guy."" But that is not the case. I have no issues with him. So as far as I'm concerned, nothing is afoot. I understand why I have played the number of games that I have played. Everybody is entitled to an opinion but I don't think that anybody has had a conversation with me or with AVB."" It is impossible to talk to Assou-Ekotto without being assaulted by his frankness. In February 2007, in his first season at Tottenham, he heard his left knee click and was told, during an absence of 18 months, that he would never play again. So when it is put to him that this season's lay-off might have been difficult, he laughs. ""Four months out … don't care, it's so small,"" he says. ""I knew why I was out this time and I could see when I would get back. The body said, 'Stop', and you have to stop. You can cry, be sad, whatever. It changes nothing."" Above all, though, there is Assou-Ekotto's notorious candour about his profession, which has reinforced his cult status in some quarters but fired indignation in others. that he considered football to be little more than a job, in which money was the driving force and, as such, he had to be viewed as a type of mercenary. ""The reaction persists and, in France, it has been predominantly negative to the point where I find it almost pretentious,"" he says, of the country of his birth. ""To say that players should not appreciate the context in which they operate is stupid. Football is like a business now. ""In England, it's more objective. People are more cool about players earning millions. It's also not whether they agree with what I say, it's that there is a respect for the fact I was man enough to say it. I must say, as well, that I have seen quite a few Spurs players kiss the badge and then fuck off. I am still here."" If it were up to him, he would stay for longer than the remaining two years on his contract and he notes the irony of the length of his service. ""What sort of mercenary stays for seven years?"" he asks. Tottenham and life in London have got under his skin. ""There is a part of me now that has a strong bond with the club,"" Assou-Ekotto continues. ""I would be quite happy to see out my playing career here, although I know that it's not my call to make. I have every desire to see out my contractual obligations and, if possible, extend so that I can be here for long enough to play at the new stadium."" Assou-Ekotto does not like change and he was initially unnerved by Levy's decision to sack Harry Redknapp last June. He heard the news as he attended the Africa 2.0 conference in Nigeria, which aimed to find solutions to the continent's problems. ""It was hosted by [the former Nigeria] President [Olusegun] Obasanjo and I remember him asking me what on earth I was doing there,"" Assou-Ekotto says. ""I was the only footballer. ""I phoned Harry straight away. I liked working with him, he has a cool attitude. With AVB, it's more tactical, in terms of understanding your different team-mates and the opposition. He changes his teams more, moves them around. Some players will play two or three different positions in a single match. ""The one thing that I can say with certainty is the chairman has the club moving in the right direction. I have a tremendous amount of respect for the difficulty of his work and his business decisions might make people sad. But I've seen the growth, first-hand, over seven years. You have to respect that."" Assou-Ekotto intends to remain a part of it for years to come."	Football
3789	3790	Google takes down more than eight 'pirate' links every second 	" took down a record-breaking 5.3 million allegedly infringing links from its search engine in the last week of September, equivalent to just under nine links every second. The data, released as part of , shows a significant rise in the number of takedown notices filed by copyright holders to Google over the last year. Between July and October 2012 copyright holders sent Google about 1.8m link takedown notices a week, increasing to 2.8m a week in November 2012 and 3.8m in mid-December 2012. In February 2013, takedown notices hit 3.8m a week, increasing to 4.47m at the end of March, and finally peaking in the final week of September hitting 5.3m spanning 37,413 domains from 5,407 copyright owners, which marked a 4008% increase over the first notice listings by Google in July 2011. In contrast to the increasing action of copyright holders,   by the London School of Economics (LSE) has found that ""evidence does not support claims about overall revenue reduction due to individual online copyright infringement"". ""The marketing benefits and sales boosts arising from the sharing of films online are starting to be seen as compensating for losses in revenue due to infringing sharing, and the digital world is thriving on ubiquitous digital content sharing."" In fact, according to the report, UK revenues from online music were higher than revenues for both CDs and vinyl combined for the first time in 2013, showing growth in the sector. Worldwide sales of recorded music also increased in 2012 for the first time since 1999. The movie industry is seeing growth too, despite the Motion Picture Association of America’s (MPAA) claims that piracy is devastating its bottom line. Global box office revenues hit $35bn in 2012, marking a 6% increase on 2011, according to the report. ""File-sharers in the UK were found to spend more on content than those who only consumed legal content, demonstrating the potential boost to legal digital content sales as a result of content sampling."" The report concludes that those industries that have embraced digital distribution are seeing increases in revenues, that online sharing has benefits for media creation and that ""evidence-based legislation on copyright enforcement is needed that independently assesses the claims of the dominant creative industry firms and the impacts on users in the light of today’s digital culture."""

3552	3553	Coalition is scapegoating SPC Ardmona in a union witch-hunt, says Liberal MP 	The government is “scapegoating” and exaggerating “piffling” issues in the companies’ enterprise agreement to draw the struggling fruit manufacturer into a “union witch-hunt”, the Coalition backbencher Sharman Stone has said. But the treasurer, Joe Hockey, declared cabinet’s refusing SPC’s request for $25m to help retool its Shepparton fruit canning plant showed that under the Coalition “the age of entitlement is over and the age of personal responsibility has begun”. He told ABC radio in Brisbane that Coca-Cola Amatil, which owns SPC Ardmona, was an “incredibly successful” and “profitable” company but “even by their own admission they haven’t run it properly”. “The bottom line for us is they were asking the taxpayers for $50m to buy new plant and equipment … so Coca-Cola Amatil could make a larger profit,” Hockey said, as he campaigned for next weekend’s byelection in the Brisbane seat of Griffith. “This is not the proper use of taxpayers’ money, this is the decision the cabinet came to. Everyone in Australia must do the heavy lifting now.” Tony Abbott and several ministers have pointed to “perks” and “excessive” provisions in SPC’s enterprise agreement, including a “wet” allowance and a “food preservers’ picnic day” holiday the Monday before Melbourne Cup day. But Stone, the member for the seat of Murray which includes Shepparton, said the provisions were “piffling” and “add up at most to a few thousand dollars when the company has been losing millions at the plant because of the broader economic conditions and because of the government’s policies.” The “wet” allowance, she said, had only ever been paid to workers who provided their own protective “space suits” to be worn when using caustic soda to clean the plant. It had not been paid for at least two years, since the company began providing the safety suits. And the extra holiday at Melbourne Cup time was because workers had agreed to take a day in the “down season” for fruit canning in lieu of extra hours accumulated during the year. “The government is scapegoating the company … denigrating a good company ... and trying to link it to a witch-hunt against the unions rather than face up to the real problems which are the continuing high dollar, the failure of our anti-dumping regime and the failure to properly safety test competing products that come in from overseas.” “There are some rogue unions, especially in the building industry, but it is not fair to scapegoat SPC to distract from the government’s own decisions and the real problems in the economy,” she said. Hockey said enterprise agreements “come down to the partnership between employers and employees, if that is what they negotiate. Do not come to the government asking for other taxpayers’ money when those enterprises fail.” The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, just returned from an overseas trip, is travelling to Shepparton on Monday to tour the factory and speak to workers. Coca-Cola Amatil is expected to make a decision about the future of the factory on 17 February. About 3,000 jobs in the Goulburn valley depend on SPC. The company is not commenting on the ongoing public discussion of its workplace arrangements. At the time of the cabinet decision last week, the chief executive, Terry Davis said: “The government decision is disappointing in light of the fact that SPC Ardmona had presented to both the federal and Victorian governments a solid business case for a one-off co-investment of $25m each with CCA committing to a significant and much greater investment of more than $90m.” “This was to be invested in best-in-class technology for both new product development and for efficiency gains to enable the transformation of the production facility in the Goulburn valley into a modern, high-tech food company, utilising clean, green Australian-grown fruit and vegetables.” Announcing the decision to refuse SPC’s request for co-funding last week Abbott said: “I would invite you to have a flick through the existing enterprise bargaining agreement which, as I said, is way in excess of the award. “There are wet allowances, there are loadings on top of overtime, there is the ability to cash out sick pay. You get two weeks’ redundancy for every six months of service up to 104 weeks. “This is a pretty an extraordinary EBA and the company admits that in the past this hasn’t been well handled.”	Business

And the evening suffered from a very uncertain host performance from poor , who never seemed sure if he was going to be an old-fashioned showtune guy or a real standup comic. He remained amiable and likable, but died a slow death, with an absence of laughs. He had nothing like the energy or pizzazz of Ellen DeGeneres last year, with her web-smashing selfie, or indeed Tina Fey and Amy Poehler at the Golden Globes. My colleague Stuart Heritage called this event the American Eurovision, and that about sums up its weird directionless kitschiness. The Academy had already come close to disgracing itself by snubbing Ava DuVernay and David Oyelowo from Selma, the film about Martin Luther King. Now it has further failed to distinguish itself with something that is almost another snub — failing to give the best picture award to Richard Linklater’s marvellous Boyhood. It had the chance to mark out a real classic, and in so doing reinforce the Oscar’s own brand-value. But no. The best supporting actress Oscar went to as the boy’s mother, a just reward for a passionate performance and a tremendous key closing scene. But that was it. The Academy withheld the best picture prize at the last moment and gave it to Birdman, directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, having already given the best director prize to Iñárritu, as well giving the film best cinematography and best original screenplay. At the risk of being churlish, it seems like the wrong choice to me. That said, Birdman is certainly a wonderful movie. This fantasia of midlife showbusiness status-anxiety was very original, though with a broad touch of Mel Brooks and The Producers. It is superbly shot, excitingly staged and hilariously acted. Michael Keaton was lovely in the role. His face, though crumpled and creased with disappointment and middle age, always looked heartwrenchingly boyish. There was agony in that face – and a terrible black-comic hope that his whole life would be redeemed by success. Great stuff, and great stuff from Naomi Watts, Ed Norton, Emma Stone and Andrea Riseborough. Watching Birdman was like knocking back a vodka-and-tonic. Exciting, brilliant film-making. But : deeper and more substantial. Both the lead acting prizes went to characters with disabilities, but despite the industry cliches involved here, these were both very well deserved. as someone who instinctively knows how to modify the vague or patrician mannerisms of a lauded university teacher to cover up her growing dementia. I worry that the movie itself was a bit flat, compared to the quality of its central performance. But arguably it is deliberately that way, downplayed, in order better to showcase Moore’s presence. So kudos is also due to this movie’s smart young British producer, Lex Lutzus. Eddie Redmayne did himself proud – and did Working Title proud – with his award-winning run in the role of Stephen Hawking in . He very plausibly represented Hawking’s physical decline and intelligently represented the enigma of Hawking’s attitude to his marriage as it both collapsed, and yet in some other more enigmatic way survived, both as friendship and professional alliance. He is an actor who has matured hugely from the beautiful-boy roles that marked the earlier part of his career: he seized the role and made it his own. What a triumph this film has been for him. JK Simmons was the much-predicted best supporting actor Oscar-winner, playing the terrifying music teacher in , and his speech had the more experienced actor’s good-natured level-headedness. He always has given the impression that he is someone who is equally unimpressed with what Kipling called the impostors of victory and defeat. His Oscar was a feelgood moment. did not come away empty-handed: an Oscar for Graham Moore for best adapted screenplay. That prize was a bit of an outlier. The movie was reasonably scripted and the fact that it held and entertained so many audiences (as it undoubtedly has done) is a tribute to Moore. But the film itself was remarkable more for its accomplished and studied performance from Benedict Cumberbatch than for anything else. Elsewhere, there were throughly admirable awards for Paweł Pawlikowski’s Ida as best foreign film and Laura Poitras’s as best documentary — and Wes Anderson’s had something for the silverware cabinet for its design qualities. But again, I come back to the Boyhood snub. Is it too much to call it Boyhoodgate? What happened? This great film has somehow been given a swerve. It’s baffling. But congratulations are due to Iñárritu, a brilliant and original film-maker for creating , a movie which took flight at the 2015 Oscars.	Film
2548	2549	Google's Project Tango reveals location-aware phone 	A new project aims to give mobile devices the ability to understand their location in a room, offering the prospect of mapping interiors or measuring living spaces with just a phone. “ ” was announced by the search firm on Thursday, and Johnny Lee, the project’s leader, described it as aiming “to give mobile devices a human-scale understanding of space and motion”. The project is based on a mixture of software and hardware innovations. Key to the prototypes is a 5in phone with a variety of positioning sensors, including what appear to be stereo cameras, that Google says gives it the ability “to make over a quarter million 3D measurements every second”. Combined with special software, the phone is able “to track the full 3D motion of the device, while simultaneously creating a map of the environment”. Having created the hardware and basic software, the company is now looking for third parties to build on top of the platform. Google provides prompts for potential game ideas (“Imagine playing hide-and-seek in your house with your favorite game character, or transforming the hallways into a tree-lined path”) and for potential applications (“What if visually impaired people could navigate unassisted in unfamiliar indoor places? What if you could search for a product and see where the exact shelf is located in a super-store?”). “Professional developers with dreams of creating more than a touch-screen app” can apply for one of 200 prototype development kits. Everyone else will have to wait for the technology to make it into production devices – and Google isn’t yet saying when that will happen. 	Technology
2614	2615	Ed Miliband: we only use the smaller of our two kitchens 	One of the pre-election cycle’s less anticipated controversies has taken a fresh turn with Ed Miliband’s confirmation that he does indeed have two kitchens in his north London house – but he says he only uses the smaller one. News of the Milibands’ culinary extravagance emerged when the leader and his wife, Justine, were photographed by the BBC drinking tea in a small, spartan kitchen at home. After Sarah Vine, a Daily Mail columnist, mocked the pair for having such a “forlorn” room, another columnist, Jenni Russell – who is a friend of the Milibands – leapt to their defence. Russell explained ( that Labour’s first family might not have entirely appreciated) that the Milibands have two kitchens. The one pictured, she wrote, was the “functional kitchenette by sitting room for tea and quick snacks”. Ed Miliband's kitchen is lovely. Daily Mail pix: the functional kitchenette by sitting room for tea and quick snacks. Asked on Twitter if the Milibands really had two kitchens, Russell said the smaller one was more like a “tea prep area”. In his first comments on a storm that, while minor, risks painting Miliband as out of touch with everyday concerns, the Labour leader said they barely used the bigger kitchen – the one Russell called “lovely”. “The house we bought had a kitchen downstairs when we bought it,” he . “And it is not the one we use. We use the small one upstairs.” Pressed on why he was pictured in the smaller kitchen, he said: “This is the kitchen Justine and I use.” He added: “I think Justine would probably say she wishes I’d spend more time in the kitchen.”	Politics
439	440	Yukos investors expect multibillion payout in expropriation of assets case 	"Investors in the former Russian oil company Yukos are confident they will receive a multi-billion pound financial settlement on Monday in a landmark case that threatens maximum embarrassment for and the Kremlin at a sensitive time. Europe's top arbitration court in The Hague has been hearing a case about the illegal expropriation of assets brought by five investors including the former Yukos chief executive, Platon Lebedev. A ruling in favour of GML, the majority shareholders in Yukos, would be damaging to BP because the disputed Yukos assets ended up in the hands of another major oil company, Rosneft, in which it owns a 20% stake. It would also be a setback for the Kremlin at a time when it is under pressure from the west over its role in eastern Ukraine. The claim, under the energy charter treaty, amounts to $103.5bn (£61bn), but the court will decide how much compensation GML should receive if the ruling goes in its favour. In the event of GML succeeding, Russia's response will be widely watched. Yukos was originally set up by Mikhail Khodorkovsky with Lebedev's help, but the company crumbled in 2004 when the Russian government demanded it paid $27bn in taxes. Both Khodorkovsky and Lebedev were jailed. They have recently been released, but Yukos's oil fields and other assets were auctioned off and eventually bought by Rosneft. Yukos, once Russia's biggest company, and many western supporters maintained that the tax bill and jailings were a result of Vladimir Putin wanting to rid himself of oligarchs who were using their corporate power base to meddle in politics. But the Kremlin has always argued that all the actions taken against Yukos and its executives were entirely justified under Russian law. Khodorkovsky sold off his interest in Yukos to pay his legal expenses, but Lebedev and GML have brought what is believed to be the largest ever arbitration case in history. The litigation was first filed in February 2005 but it took until 2009 before a ruling about the jurisdiction and admissibility of the claim was made in GML's favour. Tim Osborne, a British lawyer and director of GML, is planning to make a statement about the arbitration findings when the court in The Hague makes its final ruling at 9am London time. The result is not yet known, but industry sources said: ""They are organising a big press conference. They would not be doing this unless they expected to win."""	Business
4543	4544	Robbie Rogers: why coming out as gay meant I had to leave football 	" needs to be brave again on another freezing morning in east London. Even walking down the stairs to open the big black door to his apartment takes courage – for this is how the next stage begins. Once the door swings open he will be back on an emotionally bruising ride into the open. It helps that, last month, which, on his website, confirmed that, ""Life is simple when your secret is gone. Gone is the pain that lurks in the stomach at work, the pain from avoiding questions, and at last the pain from hiding such a deep secret."" Rogers, who has represented the United States in 18 international football matches, was signed by Leeds United in January 2012. His time at the club was blighted by injury but he played briefly for Leeds and this season, on loan, for . He left Leeds ""by mutual consent"" three months ago. Rogers then became only the second gay footballer in Britain to come out in public. Justin Fashanu, his solitary predecessor, hanged himself in 1998 in Shoreditch, just a short walk from where Rogers now lives. ""Secrets can cause so much internal damage,"" Rogers wrote. ""People love to preach about honesty, how honesty is so plain and simple. Try explaining to your loved ones after 25 years you are gay."" Rogers, from a close-knit conservative Christian family in America, has kept the world at a safe distance since . He has been besieged with large offers of money for interviews and contracts, as well as moving emails from thousands of people who have thanked him or asked how they might uncover the truth about themselves. Rogers has turned down every money-man; but he has written to some ordinary people. Today marks a big step forward for himself and, as he says, ""people like me."" On a day of fierce cold, beneath a heavy grey sky, Rogers is a long way from home. As a self-confessed Californian dude who grew up playing soccer, surfing and going to church in a sun-kissed place, he misses his family. But Rogers needs to be strong when talking for the first time in public about his sexuality and all it took to reach a point of honesty as pure as it is still raw. Inside his rented flat, while Rogers makes coffee and introduces me to Jeffrey, his five-month-old dog and close pal, he is relaxed. It helps that we had met a week before, to discuss if and how we might talk, but Rogers admits his trepidation: ""It felt scary when this day was coming close. First, it was a case of I'm never going to come out. Next, I'm going to come out to my friends and family. And then I'm going to come out to the world and do interviews? It's like: 'Oh, my gosh, what's next?' So last night I was nervous – but excited."" The backdrop for a professional sportsman is so harsh that coming out usually feels impossible. There have been notable exceptions – from the Welsh rugby player to the Puerto Rican boxer . Yet even those hard and violent trades are more forgiving than the tribal world of football. It is still loved by so many of us, and mythologised as ""the beautiful game"", but football has long been a place where bigotry, greed and ignorance thrive. Rogers will become a symbol and a spokesman but it's important to remember that, more than just a pioneering gay footballer, he is a 25-year-old man who stepped out of the shadows of his secret history. ""I had a very happy childhood,"" he says. ""Very story-book. Conservative, Catholic family. Five kids. I'm the middle child so [Rogers laughs] I was destined to be gay. California is amazing and, all the while, I had a football at my feet. We had this giant driveway and I'd kick the ball up and down for hours. I loved it."" Rogers also fell in love, in a one-way long-distance relationship, with Arsenal. He sounds smitten when remembering the great Arsenal team of a decade ago, Arsene Wenger's side of steel and subtlety which went unbeaten through an entire Premier League season. ""It's tough being an Arsenal fan right now, but I fell for the beauty and toughness of that team. They had such beautiful players. Patrick Vieira was so hard he could kill someone, and then he'd pop the ball on his chest and hit this dink of a pass with such artistry. When we were playing in the streets my team was always Arsenal."" Amid gorgeous days of sunshine and soccer, with Rogers being talented enough to make national youth squads from 14 onwards, conflicting emotions unfurled inside him. ""I started feeling very different and it was a case of, 'All right, I'm good at football and I get attention from girls. Why don't I want that? What's wrong with me?' I realised I was gay when I was 14 or 15. I was like, 'I want to play football. But there are no gay footballers. What am I going to do?' ""You feel such an outcast. I just couldn't tell anyone because high school in the States is brutal. You're going through puberty and kids can be vicious. I was lucky my older sisters were cool people and I was the football guy. All these things made it easier to mask myself. But it was also difficult. You have girls coming on to you and you're like, 'Shit, it would be a lot easier if they weren't interested and I could just play football.' I kept saying: 'I can't go out because I have training today or a match tomorrow.'"" Did Rogers force himself to go out with girls as a way of appearing 'normal'? ""Of course. Yeah. I tried to change myself. I would date beautiful, intelligent, amazing girls – if I was straight maybe I would have been going nuts. Some of them are still my friends."" After a year at the Dutch club Heerenveen, Rogers excelled on his return to America where, at Columbus Crew, . ""We won that trophy in LA, in front of my family, with this amazing team. Afterwards we went to a bar and I was like, 'I should be so happy now…' But I left after a few drinks and sat on my own in my room, thinking, 'OK. I'm gay. But I can't come out because I love football so much. What am I going to do?' The more successful you become the harder it is to step away."" In England, Rogers became acutely aware of the impossibility of being a publicly-out gay footballer. He was an established international and his most recent caps had been won under Jürgen Klinsmann – whose first game in charge ended in a draw, against Mexico, after an . But he understood the bitter truth: ""In football it's obviously impossible to come out – because no-one has done it. No one. It's crazy and sad. I thought: 'Why don't I step away and deal with this and my family and be happy?' Imagine going to training every day and being in that spotlight? It's been a bit of a circus anyway – but that would have been crazy. And you wouldn't have much control because clubs are pushing you in different directions. ""I was just fearful. I was very fearful how my team-mates were going to react. Was it going to change them? Even though I'd still be the same person would it change the way they acted towards me – when we were in the dressing room or the bus?"" In all professional sport, dressing room ""banter"", in that euphemistic phrase, can be callous. ""Especially football,"" Rogers stresses. How did he react when homophobic quips were made – even though his team-mates were oblivious to his sexuality? ""There were different emotions. Sometimes I would feel bad for them. Sometimes I would laugh because it was kinda funny. And, sometimes, it got malicious. ""That was when I would get this awful feeling in my stomach. I would turn my head and try to chat about other things. They often don't mean what they say. It's that pack mentality – they're trying to get a laugh, they're trying to be the top guy. But it's brutal. It's like high school again – on steroids."" Rogers speaks warmly of individual footballers. ""They're amazing people, really. Professional footballers are very interesting and from all walks of life. They have great stories when you get them away from the banter and the pack. They can really open up. To become a professional footballer there is something special about you. You need this drive, this hunger."" Yet there is also something diseased at the heart of professional football – epitomised by its attitude towards homosexuality. ""Football is an amazing sport,"" Rogers says. ""But it is also a brutal sport that picks people up and slams them on their heads. Adding the gay aspect doesn't make a great cocktail."" What would have happened if Rogers had still been playing for Leeds when he came out? ""That would have been interesting,"" he says wryly. ""I don't think I would have been able to go training the next day. That would be so scary. The guys might have said, 'That's great, Robbie.' Maybe. But because no-one's done it and because of the things I've heard in the dressing room I just thought: 'I need to get away from this – make my announcement, find peace, go from there.' So I can never imagine announcing that at Leeds."" Could he have come out while playing for Columbus in the US? ""No. Not at any club – anywhere."" And, back in this country, if he was playing for Leeds and they were away to Millwall today? ""Woah!"" Rogers exclaims. ""I can't even think about that."" We end up laughing, helplessly, which shows how much football has to change. ""Definitely. Maybe a lot of fans aren't homophobic. But, in a stadium, sometimes they want to destroy you. In the past I would have said: 'They don't know I'm gay so it doesn't mean anything.' But, now they know it, am I going to jump in the stands and fight them?"" It would be incredibly powerful if a gay footballer could face down that hate and abuse – just as black sportsmen like Jackie Robinson and Muhammad Ali stood up to racism in America. ""Sure,"" Rogers says. ""I've thought about that. I might be strong enough but I don't know if that's really what I want. I'd just want to be a footballer. I wouldn't want to deal with the circus. Are people coming to see you because you're gay? Would I want to do interviews every day, where people are asking: 'So you're taking showers with guys – how's that?' ""If you're playing well it will be reported as: 'The gay footballer is playing well.' And if you have a bad game it'll be: 'Aw, that gay dude … he's struggling because he's gay.' Fuck it. I don't want to mess with that."" Yet the response to his coming out seems to have been . ""It's been very warm, very accepting. Guys I played with have sent messages saying, 'You know I was joking when I said that?' I say, 'Bro, don't worry about it. You were hilarious. Don't worry.'"" He becomes thoughtful when asked if he knows any gay footballers. ""No. Even now, one of my best friends said: 'Do we know anyone else in football who could possibly be gay?' And we couldn't think of anyone. We're such great actors because we're afraid to let people know who we are. We've been trained by our agents how to do interviews, how to present ourselves. No footballer has since said to me, 'Robbie, thank you, I'm gay too…' I don't know if anyone will."" Many gay men, surely, are playing professional football? ""Of course. Tons. I mean footballers dress really well [he laughs]."" Could he imagine a young gay footballer knocking on his manager's door to ask for advice? ""It would be so tough. Would I have had the same opportunities when I was younger if I'd come out? I don't think so. There would have been that mentality: 'Oh he's gay … how will that affect the team?'"" The way in which Fashanu was treated has been a bleak warning to any gay footballer. He might have been a million pound player but Brian Clough, one of the greatest managers this country has produced, demeaned him at Nottingham Forest as ""a bloody poof."" Fashanu's tragic end should never be forgotten. ""I read a little about him,"" Rogers says. ""It's such a sad story because my coming out was so positive. I wish everyone could have that same support. If people say bad things about you, you can give your parents a call. But hearing – oh my gosh."" As we consider the way in which Clough treated Fashanu at Forest, Rogers says: 'I've heard it recently from coaches. Obviously they're not homophobic but they'll say: 'Don't pass the ball like a fag.' That's when you look at them and think, 'Fuck you. What are you talking about? Does it make a difference, if you're gay or straight, as to how you pass the ball? Are you on drugs?' I guess they say it because they think it's funny. There's the stereotype of a gay man being soft and flamboyant."" Rogers sounds like a necessary force for change. He shrugs. ""About a month ago I would've thought: 'I don't want to be a spokesman for gay footballers.' I have so many different things I'm interested in. But after thousands of emails, I'm thinking, OK, how can I help others? How can I make some positive change? How am I going to reach young Robbie and tell him to be himself? He might not fit the gay or the football stereotype. That's one thing I definitely want to do – break some barriers and kill some stereotypes."" The footballer smiles at Jeffrey. ""I'm saying all this with a gay dog sitting on my lap. It's ridiculous. But I'm ready to share my story and help people any way I can – but on my terms."" Last December Rogers wrote the 408 words which changed his life. ""I was sitting on my bed, lights off, on my laptop, in a good place. Pure emotion poured out of me and the words came easy. I didn't even proof-read it."" A week earlier I'd told Rogers how, when I showed his blog to my teenage daughter, she described it as a beautiful piece of writing. ""I told my mom that,"" Rogers says. ""When I wrote it I thought I'd maybe never post it because I was still a footballer at Stevenage then."" On 15 February, Rogers ""didn't even know I was posting it that day. I was talking to a friend and he said, 'Dude, send it out or don't. It's getting annoying.' My laptop was sitting there. So I thought, 'Let me post it. What can happen?' I posted my blog and went to Shoreditch House. I had a bunch of drinks and pizza. I got a little drunk. It was a case of, 'All right, I did it!'"" Did he harbour any doubts? ""No! My friend was checking his Twitter. He told me: 'It's going nuts.' I said: 'It doesn't matter. My phone's off. No one can reach me. I'm totally free.'"" He had already taken his first steps towards freedom when he told his eldest sister. ""Alicia is a strong character, opinionated, but very cool and lovely. I said, 'I'm sending you an email now as I need to get all my feelings down. Read it and then call me.' It was a long letter but she seemed to read it in 10 seconds. She Skyped me back and I was like 'OK, here we go.' We talked forever. She was so loving. ""She kept saying 'Robbie, it doesn't matter. I'm just so happy you're at peace.' My sister is very religious. I was afraid to tell her but it was great. She said: 'OK, how are you going to tell mom, what are you doing next, are you dating anyone?' It was a huge interview. I was so happy. It was like: 'Whew, that weight's gone…'"" His mother was equally supportive. ""When I told her, she made me cry. She was so loving and positive. I was expecting her to be apprehensive but she just said: 'I love you so much.' There's that line I wrote – 'Honesty is a bitch but it makes life so clear and simple.' My mom said it's great you can be honest about everything. People might disagree but at least you tell them the truth. People will see you're authentic.'"" Besides that authenticity, Rogers is also smart. He has today all mapped out. Before he talks later, via Google, to the New York Times, we do another interview at lunchtime. This time we're filmed for a in central London. We feel awkward, especially me, rehashing an interview which had felt so spontaneous during an old-fashioned one-to-one at his apartment. But Rogers doesn't mind. The aim of working with Google is to produce segments of him talking which can be viewed discreetly. A secretly gay person might feel unable to sit with their family and watch him on a television chat show – but they can choose to hear his story in private on their laptops or phones. The future, for Rogers, appears intriguingly open-ended. He flies to New York this weekend and will meet people at Ralph Lauren so they can decide whether he is suited to their new campaign. He has also won himself a place at the London School of Fashion and could begin a three-year course in September. But he might just have enough talent, contacts and nous to concentrate on – the menswear brand he co-owns in LA. And then, of course, there is football. ""Most days I wake up and I go to my computer and look at my emails and then go onto the football sites. Football will always be part of me. I don't know if I'm done playing yet. I might ask [the coach] Bruce Arena if I can train with LA Galaxy – we'll see. I miss it and think about it a lot. But I'm so happy now I don't want to mess with that. Football was my life and maybe I'll need to go back … or maybe I'll just be a fan. But it's an industry where there are lots of problems – from sketchy agents to homophobic culture."" Throughout the day, and never forgetting that Justin Fashanu was black, we've discussed the way in which certain prejudices have shifted. In the 1980s, some white men in English football voiced their belief that black players ""disappeared"" when winter began to bite. Black footballers were dismissed as psychologically weak and tactically inept. Bananas were thrown at great players like John Barnes. There is still racism now, but life has improved. Does Rogers believe that, eventually, similar progress can be made in overcoming football's last taboo? ""Yes. I know things will change. There will be gay footballers. I just don't know when and how long it will take. The next step is how do you create an atmosphere where men and women feel it's OK to come out and continue to play? It's a great question. Football has so much history. It's a great sport with so much culture and tradition. But I'm positive there will be changes."" It's sobering to consider how far this old game needs to move before it includes gay players. Yet the battle will be fought more intently now; and Rogers will play his groundbreaking role with intelligence, resilience and wit. His own struggle has already been won and he laughs when he sees all the hip young things at Google crooning over Jeffrey. ""You'll have to get that dog an agent,"" I suggest. ""Oh,"" Rogers says, rolling his eyes, ""I'm his agent. I'm happy for him to take my shine."" He smiles, scooping up Jeffrey, and says, ""Hey, we're done."" The latest day of revelation is over, and the secrets and shadows of his past retreat still further. Robbie Rogers appears much more than just a lone gay footballer now. He looks 25 again, with the rest of his life stretched out before him, studded with promise and opportunity and, most of all, happiness and hope."	Football
6770	6771	Co-op Bank investors back £1.5bn rescue 	"The threat of emergency intervention by the into the Co-operative Bank receded on Friday night after thousands of retail investors gave their backing to a £1.5bn lifeline for the troubled high street bank. The support of the bondholders is a major step towards avoiding Threadneedle Street having to step in to wind up the bank but is part of a process that will force the Co-op Group – which owns supermarkets, funeral homes and pharmacies – to cede control of its banking business to bondholders, who have been led by aggressive US hedge funds. The complex restructuring is still far from complete – a number of other bondholders still need to approve the deal – but the support of the retail investors was regarded as the biggest hurdle because they needed to be convinced to vote. Some 13,000 bondholders had invested £370m in the bank using financial instruments that paid high returns and were relied on by pensioners for income. Other groups of bondholders also have to vote and a number of court hearings are necessary before the fresh injection of capital into the bank will be formally agreed. Once it is, the Co-op Group will own just 30% of the bank – which is expected to be floated on the stock market late next year – and the bondholders will own the remaining 70% of the shares. In joint statement on Friday night the management of Co-op Group and Co-op Bank said they were delighted by the support. ""We are now highly confident that our £1.5bn recapitalisation plan for the Co-op Bank can be achieved,"" they said. The Bank of England has given the bank until the end of the year to plug a capital shortfall identified in June but the bank's problems escalated this month after its former chairman Paul Flowers was arrested on allegations about buying drugs. Its future has sparked a political row about whether Labour ministers encouraged the bank to merge with Britannia Building Society in 2009 – and now regarded as the source of many of its loan losses – and whether the coalition cheered on the now ill-fated attempt to take control of 631 Lloyds Group branches. because of the Flowers scandal and the fears that it would be hard to maintain its ethical approach to business once the Co-op Group was no longer in control. But it had stressed that savers – a key source of its funding – had not been leaving. The Co-op Group had warned that if bondholders had failed to back the restructuring they risked losing all their investments as the only alternative was ""resolution"" by the Bank of England."

12905	12906	Wealth doesn't trickle down – it just floods offshore, research reveals 	"he world's super-rich have taken advantage of lax tax rules to siphon off at least $21 trillion, and possibly as much as $32tn, from their home countries and hide it abroad – a sum larger than the entire American economy. James Henry, a former chief economist at consultancy McKinsey and an expert on tax havens, has conducted groundbreaking new research for the campaign group – sifting through data from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and private sector analysts to construct an alarming picture that shows capital flooding out of countries across the world and disappearing into the cracks in the financial system. Comedian Jimmy Carr became the public face of tax-dodging in the UK earlier this year when it emerged that he had made use of a Cayman Islands-based trust to slash his income tax bill. But the kind of scheme Carr took part in is the tip of the iceberg, according to Henry's report, entitled . Despite the professed determination of the G20 group of leading economies to tackle tax secrecy, investors in scores of countries – including the US and the UK – are still able to hide some or all of their assets from the taxman. ""This offshore economy is large enough to have a major impact on estimates of inequality of wealth and income; on estimates of national income and debt ratios; and – most importantly – to have very significant negative impacts on the domestic tax bases of 'source' countries,"" Henry says. Using the BIS's measure of ""offshore deposits"" – cash held outside the depositor's home country – and scaling it up according to the proportion of their portfolio large investors usually hold in cash, he estimates that between $21tn (£13tn) and $32tn (£20tn) in financial assets has been hidden from the world's tax authorities. ""These estimates reveal a staggering failure,"" says John Christensen of the Tax Justice Network. ""Inequality is much, much worse than official statistics show, but politicians are still relying on trickle-down to transfer wealth to poorer people. ""This new data shows the exact opposite has happened: for three decades extraordinary wealth has been cascading into the offshore accounts of a tiny number of super-rich."" In total, 10 million individuals around the world hold assets offshore, according to Henry's analysis; but almost half of the minimum estimate of $21tn – $9.8tn – is owned by just 92,000 people. And that does not include the non-financial assets – art, yachts, mansions in Kensington – that many of the world's movers and shakers like to use as homes for their immense riches. ""If we could figure out how to tax all this offshore wealth without killing the proverbial golden goose, or at least entice its owners to reinvest it back home, this sector of the global underground is easily large enough to make a significant contribution to tax justice, investment and paying the costs of global problems like climate change,"" Henry says. He corroborates his findings by using national accounts to assemble estimates of the cumulative capital flight from more than 130 low- to middle-income countries over almost 40 years, and the returns their wealthy owners are likely to have made from them. In many cases, , the total worth of these assets far exceeds the value of the overseas debts of the countries they came from. The struggles of the authorities in Egypt to recover the vast sums hidden abroad by Hosni Mubarak, his family and other cronies during his many years in power have provided a striking recent example of the fact that kleptocratic rulers can use their time to amass immense fortunes while many of their citizens are trapped in poverty. The world's poorest countries, particularly in sub-Saharan , have fought long and hard in recent years to receive debt forgiveness from the international community; but this research suggests that in many cases, if they had been able to draw their richest citizens into the tax net, they could have avoided being dragged into indebtedness in the first place. Oil-rich Nigeria has seen more than $300bn spirited away since 1970, for example, while Ivory Coast has lost $141bn. Assuming that super-rich investors earn a relatively modest 3% a year on their $21tn, taxing that vast wall of money at 30% would generate a very useful $189bn a year – more than rich economies spend on aid to the rest of the world. The sheer scale of the hidden assets held by the super-rich also suggests that standard measures of inequality, which tend to rely on surveys of household income or wealth in individual countries, radically underestimate the true gap between rich and poor. Milorad Kovacevic, chief statistician of the UN Development Programme's Human Development Report, says both the very wealthy and the very poor tend to be excluded from mainstream calculations of inequality. ""People that are in charge of measuring inequality based on survey data know that the both ends of the distribution are underrepresented – or, even better, misrepresented,"" he says. ""There is rarely a household from the top 1% earners that participates in the survey. On the other side, the poor people either don't have addresses to be selected into the sample, or when selected they misquote their earnings – usually biasing them upwards."" Inequality is widely seen as having increased sharply in many developed countries over the past decade or more – as described in a , which showed marked increases in the so-called Gini coefficient, which economists use to measure how evenly income is shared across societies. Globalisation has exposed low-skilled workers to competition from cheap economies such as China, while the surging profitability of the financial services industry – and the spread of the big bonus culture before the credit crunch – led to what economists have called a ""racing away"" at the top of the income scale. However, Henry's research suggests that this acknowledged jump in inequality is a dramatic underestimate. , author of the recent book , says: ""There is absolutely no doubt at all that the statistics on income and wealth at the top understate the problem."" The surveys that are used to compile the Gini coefficient ""simply don't touch the super-rich,"" he says. ""You don't pick up the multimillionaires and billionaires, and even if you do, you can't pick it up properly."" In fact, some experts believe the amount of assets being held offshore is so large that accounting for it fully would radically alter the balance of financial power between countries. The French economist Thomas Piketty, an expert on inequality who helps compile the , says research by his colleagues has shown that ""the wealth held in tax havens is probably sufficiently substantial to turn Europe into a very large net creditor with respect to the rest of the world."" In other words, even a solution to the eurozone's seemingly endless sovereign debt crisis might be within reach – if only Europe's governments could get a grip on the wallets of their own wealthiest citizens.

10516	10517	Martin O'Neill ready to begin major overhaul of Aston Villa squad 	 yesterday signalled his intention to oversee a major overhaul of his Aston Villa squad this summer by informing six fringe players that the Midlands club will listen to offers for them. Curtis Davies, Luke Young, Nigel Reo-Coker, Steve Sidwell, Nicky Shorey and Habib Beye – who all struggled to hold down a first-team place last season – were told they could leave provided Villa's valuation of them is met. All six players were O'Neill signings but few made an impression during the last campaign – only two of the group, Sidwell and Young, started more than 10 matches – as the Villa manager resisted the temptation to chop and change his side. With Randy Lerner, the Villa chairman, expected to be more circumspect in the transfer market this summer, O'Neill may well have reasoned that selling those on the periphery is necessary to generate funds to bring in fresh blood and strengthen. Davies, who was in Fabio Capello's thoughts last season but was unable to win his Villa place back at the turn of the year after returning from a lengthy spell on the sidelines following shoulder surgery, is likely to attract the biggest fee. Signed for £9m a little under two years ago, the central defender was hailed as a future Villa captain when he joined the club from West Bromwich Albion but he has been unable to dislodge the successful centre-back pairing of Richard Dunne and James Collins. Reo-Coker's future looked to be in doubt from the moment that he clashed with O'Neill on the training field near the start of the season. There appears little chance of Villa recouping anywhere near the £8.5m they paid West Ham United for the midfielder. Sidwell also seemed destined to leave following another frustrating season when he failed to recapture the form that led to a move from Reading to Chelsea before he signed for Villa. Shorey, who has spent much of this season on loan, enjoying spells at Nottingham Forest and Fulham, will have been resigned to leaving, although Villa supporters will be disappointed to see Young depart. The former England international, who is expected to join Fulham, received a rousing ovation when he was introduced as a substitute against Blackburn Rovers on Sunday and can count himself unfortunate to have lost his place to Carlos Cuéllar last season.

7623	7624	Catalogue of malpractice endorsed by bankers laid bare in HSBC files 	The files, the biggest banking leak in history, reveal the full scale of malpractice at its Swiss subsidiary. Recent court cases in the US and Europe have provided individual examples of the bank’s wrongdoing, but the leaked files show how these cases were part of a persistent pattern of misconduct. In one case that illustrates the bank’s conduct, a wealthy British client, Stoke City football club director Keith Humphreys, frankly told his HSBC manager that his father’s $430,000 (£280,000) Swiss account was “not declared” to the UK tax authorities. Humphreys, whose wealth originated from the sale of a local supermarket chain, explained that one HSBC manager had already advised how to extract undeclared offshore money via a credit card. “The credit card is thus used to enable the Humphreys family to make withdrawals from ‘cash points’ when they are outside the UK,” he said. The banker, who even brought paperwork to Humphreys’ stately home in Cheshire because the client was uneasy about “walking around with a set of account-opening documents”, recorded how Humphreys was also alarmed to hear a Swiss lawyer might realise he had a secret HSBC account. “This situation initially appeared to cause some disquiet to my hosts, though this later gave way to a more relaxed attitude with the sentiment that Genevan lawyers would be discreet, something that I did nothing to discourage.” On clinching arrangements in London, the bank manager wrote: “We subsequently repaired to the Ritz, for a very enjoyable lunch.” Humphreys told the Guardian his father eventually had to repay about $224,000 (£147,000) for evading tax due to the UK. Another customer, retired accountant Andrew Sebastian, also told the Guardian how he had now been made to pay about $64,000 (£42,000) in back tax, interest and penalties. HSBC in had supplied him with £50,000 in sterling banknotes in the course of a year. At its height, HSBC’s secretive Swiss arm hid a total of $120bn (£78bn) in assets. These funds were collected from wealthy clients all over the world and have already led to criminal investigations and charges against the bank in France, Belgium, the US and Argentina. But in Britain, no legal action has been taken against HSBC and the evidence against it had never been made public until now. The leaked Swiss HSBC files implicate the bank in apparent misbehaviour all over the world. One Australia-based HSBC client planned to share his “black” account with his daughter in London. The bank noted: “The account is ‘undeclared’, a fact with which [she] may not be entirely at ease – as a compliance officer at Kleinwort Benson.” The manager wrote that the account was also not declared “to the best of my knowledge” to the tax authorities in Australia. HSBC was so keen to protect its clients that it used a codename when phoning another prominent Australian financier, Charles Goode, then chairman of the ANZ bank in Melbourne, about his US$318,000 deposit. According to the files, HSBC instructed he “would like to be called Mr Shaw”. Goode told the Guardian the use of a codename was the bank’s idea, not his, and the deposit had long been left dormant by him. He says he has paid all tax due on the account. Another HSBC manager wrote on the file of Irish businessman John Cashell (later to be convicted of a tax fraud): “His preoccupation is with the risk of disclosure to the Irish authorities. Once again I endeavoured to reassure him that there is no risk of that happening.” HSBC similarly recorded on the file of a British property developer: “He is very much concerned that … client information could be exchanged … I explained [to] him that we are bound to CH [Swiss] banking secrecy, which is one of the strictest in the world.” HSBC appears to have allowed executives of a textile firm to conceal unregistered “bearer share” certificates in a Swiss safe, which would have revealed who really owned the company. Bearer shares are banned in some countries because of their potential for abuse. The bank recorded: “In this safe are some very important documents (bearer share(s), which belong to the beneficial owner Mr DL from Israel. These shares are kept in a safe for tax reasons.” In a separate transaction, the bankers themselves recorded that they were uneasy when a Serbian businessman wanted to deposit €20m (£15m). But they merely asked him to act less conspicuously. HSBC “explained that as per today the bank did not interfere in his money transfer transactions but would have preferred to reduce those activities on a lower scale. [He] understands our concerns and will use smaller amounts”. The bankers seem to have been reluctant to take risks personally. The files record that a wealthy owner of a London furniture store and holder of a secret HSBC Swiss account, demanded HSBC “help him get back money into the UK on a ‘non-declared’ basis” by carrying in bundles of cash. HSBC offered instead to provide him or a colleague with sterling banknotes in Switzerland, recording, “what he decided to do with friends of his … was his affair”. In a revealing remark, an HSBC manager wrote on the files: “We made clear the difference between passive and active action on our part.” This tax evader also ended up repaying UK authorities, as part of a $205m (£135m) haul Britain has so far recovered from HSBC’s tax-dodging customers. Chris Meares, then overall head of HSBC private banking, assured the Treasury committee in 2008: “We prohibit our bankers from encouraging or being involved in tax evasion.” But former tax inspector Richard Brooks, author of The Great Tax Robbery, who is interviewed about HSBC on on Monday night, says: “I think they were a tax avoidance and tax evasion service. I think that’s what they were offering. They knew full well that people come to them to doge their tax liabilities. There are very few reasons to have an offshore bank account, apart from just saving tax.” The HSBC files are being published in an international collaboration including the French daily Le Monde in Paris, which first obtained the data; the Washington-based ; and BBC Panorama. HSBC says it won’t comment on many of the specific allegations because of ongoing criminal investigations and because of Swiss bank secrecy laws. But HSBC also says it has now embarked on a radical cleanup of its Swiss act. It says it has not only introduced “strict controls” on cash withdrawals, but also ended the “hold mail service” (the practice of not sending giveaway letters to customers’ home countries); and got rid of 70% of its previous customers. “HSBC has implemented numerous initiatives designed to prevent its banking services being used to evade taxes or launder money.”	Business

Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency which was born out of a combination of the original digital money, bitcoin, and the meme, which features photos of a baffled yet placid Shiba Inu with broken English written in multicoloured Comic Sans over the top. The sponsorship fundraiser began when members of Reddit's Nascar community identified up-and-coming driver Josh Wise as an underdog in need of financial support. The group appealed to the Dogecoin community for help, and after an eight-day fundraising drive, 1,200 donations averaging $41 were enough to sponsor his car, covering it in images of dogecoin and the Reddit alien. Moolah, , offered to convert the donations to US dollars at a favourable exchange rate, ensuring that the whole $55,000 raised could be spent. ""I can't thank the dogecoin and community enough for the support,"" said Wise, before quoting what has become an unofficial slogan of the Dogecoin community: ""To the moon!"" Named the ""#98 Moonrocket"", the car will make its debut on May 4th at the Aarons 499 Sprint Series Cup Race. Dogecoin hit headlines in January when the same community raised $25,000 to send the Jamaican bobsled team to the winter olympics. Since then, it has also has raised $20,000 to train service dogs for children with disabilities, and collected $30,000 to build clean water wells in Kenya. "	Technology
7494	7495	Chuka Umunna: ‘For African people, how you dress is very important’ 	 has, for once, allowed his impeccable standards of dress to slip. His beautifully tailored navy-blue suit has been covered in an orange high-vis vest as he embarks on a tour of a West Midlands car-parts factory wearing large plastic glasses and a pair of metal toe-capped boots. Multi-coloured rubber earplugs dangle from his ears. Labour’s shadow business secretary is showing that he can give George Osborne a run for his money on this own “hard hat” tour of Britain’s factory floors. Umunna is visiting the Gestamp factory in Cannock, Staffordshire, to highlight the threat posed to Britain’s membership of the EU by the Tories and to provide useful pictures for the local election candidate, Janos Toth. As the plant’s balletic robots weld car parts in the background, Umunna and Toth spot the perfect photo opportunity when they are handed an aluminium bumper for the Range Rover Evoke model. The pair gingerly hold the bumper above their heads, showing that Umunna has some way to go to match the theatricality of Michael Heseltine, one of his predecessors as the shadow cabinet member for business and industry, who once wielded another piece of metal – the House of Commons mace – at his opponents on the Labour benches. While Umunna, 36, may not quite have reached the heights of a Hezza political big beast, he is certainly one of the most prominent members of Ed Miliband’s shadow cabinet and on first-name terms with senior political figures in the EU and the US. Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland who is seen as a possible running mate for Hillary Clinton, and Emmanuel Macron, the French finance minister, are natural soulmates of Umunna, who has the poise of an alpha-male politician. On a tour of marginal seats in the East and West Midlands, Umunna greets people with a Bill Clinton-style handshake followed by a grip of the forearm. “My man,” he says to the Labour organiser who ferries him to his visits. The Umunna polish has inevitably sparked speculation that he could be a future candidate for the leadership of the Labour party, something he dismisses. “You have just got to keep your feet firmly on the ground and that’s why I don’t really indulge in that chat,” Umunna says, as he cites the advice of his political mentor, Tessa Jowell. Umunna finds himself dogged by questions about his political future after enjoying a meteoric rise through the Labour ranks since entering parliament in 2010 as MP for Streatham. Within months of that election he was appointed as Miliband’s parliamentary bag carrier (private secretary) after supporting him in the leadership contest, before finding himself catapulted a year later into one of the most senior posts in the shadow cabinet as business secretary. Jealous rivals have been left wondering whether Umunna’s thinking has been as consistent as the direction of his rise up the greasy pole. In the years before his election to parliament, he was an enthusiastic supporter of the leftwing Compass group – whose founder Neal Lawson recently suggested that the wrong sort of voter supported – and of the Blue Labour movement, whose guiding light, Maurice Glasman, stresses the importance of traditional communities. But in his time as shadow business secretary, Umunna has been consulting Blair and Peter Mandelson as he reaches out to corporate giants. Umunna sees no contradiction in looking to all wings of the Labour movement. “The future is very much going to be marrying together the best of Blue and the best of New,” he says. “I’m not the most tribal of politicians ... I think we need to get beyond the old and the new distinction: the Blair and the Brownite distinction, which I just think are completely redundant now.” Lest anyone on the Labour left fear that Umunna is selling out to big business, he had no qualms recently in turning on corporate leaders spearheaded by the Tory peer and former M&S chief Stuart Rose, who put their names to a letter endorsing the Conservatives. “Of course, you are going to get the establishment who have benefited from the status quo and broken markets complaining,” says Umunna. His language shows the influence of the Oxford academics Marc Stears and Lord Wood of Anfield, who have crafted Miliband’s approach to business: to champion responsible businesses while cracking down on the predators. This contrasts with Heseltine who promised to “intervene before breakfast, before lunch, before tea and before dinner” on behalf of business. Heseltine is, however, something of an inspiration for Umunna, who admires the way in which the former Tory deputy prime minister championed some of Britain’s most run-down and . If he is appointed business secretary after a Labour victory, Umunna hopes to sign up Heseltine to help advise him on the distribution of a special £30bn pot to be earmarked for devolution to the cities and regions. Heseltine proposed in a 2011 report for Osborne that £49bn administered by central government and £9bn in EU funding should be put into a similar pot. “There is no denying it, a lot of people in the Labour movement are quite inspired by what he’s done in rejuvenating cities and regions,” Umunna says of Heseltine. “Just because he is a Tory should not stand in the way of us working with him in the future, and I very much hope to do that.” The chancellor used the Heseltine report as the basis for his “northern powerhouse”, which has seen agreement on a major devolution of powers to the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA). Labour would go much further than Osborne with the earmarking of the £30bn pot and allowing local authorities that combine forces to retain 100% of the additional business-rates revenue generated in their area. “I don’t just want to see Scotland having devolved powers – it’s time for all parts of the UK to have that: a federal structure,” Umunna says. “Just strip away what’s done at the centre.” If Umunna does assume the levers of power in the giant business department in a few weeks’ time, he will embark on something of a diplomatic offensive with business leaders after the row about the Rose letter, though he will no doubt expect some contrition on the other side. But Umunna has spent the last four years laying the groundwork, as he showed when he went out of his way to woo the grandees of the Institute of Directors, who are noted for their leanings to the right. Umunna won over an audience of business leaders when he produced his late father’s IoD membership card, that he found after rummaging through a box kept by his mother. “My dad was probably the only member of the Institute of Directors in the 1980s who worshipped Harold Wilson, in particular, and the Labour party, and that got a big laugh when I mentioned it.” Ummuna’s father, Bennett, still has a profound effect on his son, even though he died in a car accident when the future MP was just 13. He talks proudly of his father’s rags-to-riches story after he arrived from Nigeria in Liverpool “with nothing apart from his suitcase” in the mid 60s. Umunna says: “Somebody gave him the fare to get to London where he found lodgings with friends and, yes, he washed plates in restaurants, he washed cars, he used to wash limousines. That was great because once he’d finished washing the car he could sit in the back and study for evening school, where he did his business and accountancy qualifications.” In the 70s his father met Umunna’s mother, Patricia Milmo, the daughter of the late Anglo-Irish judge Sir Helenus “Buster” Milmo, who interrogated suspected spies during the second world war alongside Kim Philby. Buster was later tasked with interrogating Philby when he came under suspicion. Umunna’s grandfather taught him about horse racing, while his father, who established a business importing and exporting goods from west Africa, gave his son a taste for commerce and a lifelong love for Crystal Palace football club, where he worked in the box office as a teenager. But his father, a director of the club, taught Umunna another important lesson. “I get quite bemused by the comments made about what I wear because, for African people, how you dress is very important,” he says. “My father, when he arrived in this country found it difficult. People would make immediate judgments about him based on the colour of his skin, whereas he did everything to make a good impression and this was a cultural thing.” Umunna’s family life in Streatham was shattered in 1992 when his father was killed in a car crash after he returned to Nigeria to seek election as governor of Anambra State, in the south east of the country, where he was a tribal chief. “He thought he was going to live to 100, but he was 50 and I was 13. It was hard, very hard. It is very formative to lose a parent at a young age, you immediately have a sense of mortality. Well, I became the man of the family, I suppose, and it was very difficult.” Nearly two decades later, the raw emotions surfaced again in the unlikely setting of the tight contest for the Labour nomination in Streatham. His mother and sister were in the audience at the final selection meeting when the candidates were asked what was the most difficult thing they had done in their life. “It completely threw me,” Umunna says, as he recalls looking up at his mother and sister. “I saw them and thought: ‘Oh my God, to be frank, it was not something that I achieved but something that we achieved as a family.’ To have got through that … for the three of us to have got through that complete upheaval in one piece was, I thought, the biggest achievement. But it wasn’t me, it was the three of us together. It was quite an emotional moment.” Umunna raises his eyes as he is reminded how his mixed-race background prompted reports that he could be Britain’s Barack Obama even before his election to parliament. “I think it is illustrative of the fact that we still have some way to go before we have a form of politics that represents modern Britain,” he says wearily. “When I arrived in Westminster, there was a certain presumption that was made about my background and I think the view was: ‘Oh well, he’s a black guy, he must have grown up on one of the council estates in Streatham.’ I’ve never made any secret of the fact that it isn’t the case, but people are quite shocked because they don’t know what category to put you in.” MPs eventually clocked Umunna’s Anglo-Irish heritage and upbringing – he went to St Dunstan’s College, a fee-paying school in London. As the son of a highly successful Nigerian immigrant, Umunna hopes the door will remain open for future enterprising west Africans armed with no more than a suitcase and their brainpower. This perhaps explains why he uses stronger language than some of his colleagues to condemn Ukip. “To be concerned about immigration and the economy is not racist, but I do think there is a virus of racism that runs through Ukip,” he says. Umunna thinks Labour has achieved a fair balance on immigration. “We must not allow, and we haven’t allowed, our European and immigration policies to be taken hostage by Nigel Farage and Ukip in the way that the Tories have,” he says as he points out that the solid foundation of the Labour manifesto has immunised the party against Tory attacks. “This is ours to win,” he says of the election. “It is going to be close and every single vote will count.” With that, Umunna jumps on the train to London to see his girlfriend, who is one of the few people who know the number to his “FAF” phone (for friends and family). The main task of his FAF circle is to keep him grounded. “There is a danger in believing your own hype.”	Politics
10618	10619	Alex Ferguson: Ryan Giggs should be given Manchester United job full time 	"Sir Alex Ferguson believes Ryan Giggs should become the next permanent manager despite the club viewing the 40-year-old as lacking the requisite experience to become David Moyes's long-term successor. Giggs was given the role on an interim basis on Tuesday after the sacking of Moyes. While the Welshman was happy to accept the job for only the last four matches of the season, Giggs is open to being the long-term No1. Despite Ferguson's backing of Moyes proving a dire miscalculation after the Scot lasted only 10 months of a six-year contract, the 71-year-old has no doubts that Giggs can succeed in the post. ""I think that he [Giggs] is the one man they should go to, really,"" Ferguson said at a fundraising dinner in Manchester this week. ""He's got 20-odd years of experience at Manchester United. I signed him as a kid at 13 years of age. He's gone through the gamut of emotions at the club – he's experienced all the highs and lows. He knows exactly what's needed to be a Manchester United player and I was so pleased he brought back in, and Nicky Butt of course – two great professionals. ""They understand the club, they are hard workers, they are straight as a die. So you have got the right combinations there, there's no doubt about that."" Giggs stated at his media briefing before Saturday's visit of Norwich City to Old Trafford that he and Ferguson have ongoing contact. ""He was the first person I picked the phone up to,"" the 40-year-old said. Kenny Dalglish and Pep Guardiola, at Liverpool and Barcelona respectively, were each managers of no or limited experience who proved successful. ""Yes, it can happen,"" Giggs said. Ferguson, before retiring last May, had talked of establishing a structure at United similar to Bayern Munich, where key roles are occupied by former successful players. He has underlined that he believes this can still be achieved. ""One of the things we have been criticised about over the years is succession planning,"" he said. ""It's a very difficult industry to say you can have succession planning. But in the case of what we were doing in the last few years, with bringing Nicky Butt into the fold, Ryan into the fold, Paul Scholes into the fold, and Gary Neville was offered a position but he decided to go into television. He could easily come back. ""The model is Bayern Munich where they had [Karl-Heinz] Rummenigge, [Gerd] Müller, [Uli] Hoeness, [Franz] Beckenbauer and [Sepp] Maier all in the camp. They were all there with their knowledge of the great Bayern Munich teams. And that was our model, and it wasn't really until David Gill came in we started doing that. And what's what we see today."" Ferguson added: ""Paul Scholes is one of these guys who has few words but the few words are so succinct, accurate and to the point. He is brilliant at it. Many times I would bring in the older guard to discuss certain things that we maybe wanted their opinion on. Scholesy had three or four words – bang, bang, bang. He was such a revelation for me for a young man to be so positive, a decision maker. ""I think Ryan will get the benefit of that now. That was the first thing Ryan did; he phoned up Scholesy – he was on holiday and called him back."""	Football
11182	11183	David Davis attacks 'Franco-style' sections of Tories' trade union bill 	The Conservative MP David Davis has attacked parts , suggesting proposed restrictions on pickets were like something out of Franco’s dictatorship in Spain. The MP, who ran against David Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, said he agreed with most of the bill. However, he said some measures were draconian, including the requirement for picketers to give their names to the police. The main point of the bill is to introduce a 50% turnout requirement for industrial action ballots, and a minimum positive vote by at least 40% of all those eligible to do so if the strike involves “important public services”. This is being fiercely opposed by trade unionists, who say it threatens their right to strike, but there are a number of subsidiary measures that are also causing alarm. These include the suggestion that unions will have to give two weeks’ notice to the police if they plan to campaign via social media. A consultation document also suggests that approved picket supervisors would have to take “reasonable steps” to tell police the name, contact details and location of those on the picket line. Workers would also have to wear an armband or badge to identify themselves. Speaking on Sky News’s Murnaghan programme on Sunday, Davis said: “I agree with most of the trade union bill. I think it’s very sensible … but there are bits of it which look OTT, like requiring pickets to give their names to the police force. What is this? This isn’t Franco’s Britain, this is Queen Elizabeth II’s Britain.” The proposals have also been criticised by Liberty, Amnesty International and the British Institute of Human Rights. The legislation will be debated in the Commons on Monday and will be strongly opposed by the Labour party and its new union-backed leader, . In his victory speech on Saturday, Corbyn said he would fight the Conservatives’ attempt to “to shackle unions”. However, the bill only has a chance of being challenged if more Conservatives, like Davis, object to restrictions on the grounds that they threaten civil liberties.	Politics

Father of the Bride III is expected to see Martin return as businessman patriarch George Banks, with Diane Keaton as his wife, Nina. Its plot centres on the couple's son Matty, originally played by Kieran Culkin – who is unconfirmed for the new film – who reveals that he is to marry the son of a US Navy Seal. Unable to process the news, the ""thunderstruck and speechless"" Banks is thrown out of the family home by Nina in the new storyline. Father of the Bride III will once again see original director and co-writer Charles Shyer taking charge of the cameras and working on the script. The new film will be the first entirely original movie in the series. The original 1991 Father of the Bride was based on the 1950 film of the same name, while 1995's Father of the Bride II was loosely based on 1951's Father's Little Dividend, a sequel to the earlier movie."

Wasn't he the fella who sold the on the streets of London back in the early 90s? Serkis says it was his days in the , and his subsequent rejection of the party line, that made him the actor he is today. As a young socialist he was angry about so much: Thatcher, unemployment, racism, you name it. Actually, his anger went back further. As a little boy he was so angry, throwing such tantrums, that his three older sisters had to hold him down while he kicked, punched and raged. He's not sure what he was angry about then, but thinks it might be something to do with his absent father, an Iraqi gynaecologist of Armenian descent who stayed in Baghdad, opened a hospital, and was briefly imprisoned by the regime, while his English wife brought up the Serkis clan in Ruislip, Middlesex. After A-levels, Serkis went to university to study visual art (he still paints) and set the world to rights. The politicised Serkis believed the world was black and white, and when he joined the SWP he thought he'd found his true home – here was a party founded on absolute certainties. But at the same time Serkis was developing as an actor, and found his political ideology coming into conflict with his professional evolution. As an actor, he discovered moral ambiguity was all. Yes, he was attracted to bad men, but he wanted to humanise his killers and blackmailers and all-round no-gooders. He even wanted to try to make us understand what motivates a paedophile serial killer such as Ian Brady. He felt he had to make a choice between the SWP and acting. We've arranged to meet at a north London pub. As I cross the road, I see him walk off, so I follow at a distance, like a private eye. Has he done a runner before we've even met? He's wearing a black leather jacket, black trousers, his hair is dyed black, his eyes are . He strides purposefully and looks a little menacing, as he so often does in films or on stage. Eventually, he stops for the traffic lights to change. I tap him on the shoulder, tell him I'm supposed to be interviewing him. He gives me a confused look, then smiles. It's the same warm, childlike smile he uses to disarm us when he's playing nasty bastards. ""Ah, it's just the pub wasn't open yet. I was looking for another one."" We head off up the street and he leads me to an alternative – small, scruffy, with a handful of people gathered round the racing on TV. Serkis has got an amazing face. When he smiles, he's charming, sexy, handsome. When he snarls, he's world-class ugly. Few actors have such elastic features – somehow he can stretch his nose, repoint his chin, flesh out his lips to order. Now he is playing , the rock'n'roll wordsmith with a polio gait, in the film . It's a classic Serkis part, wonderfully played – the beautiful grotesque who championed disabled people while raging against his misfortune, the drug-addled philanderer and loving father, the twisted cynic who can't hide his romantic optimism. As so often, Serkis inhabits the character (he even sings Dury's songs) rather than plays him. So much so that it's a surprise when I see he's not limping today. We're sat down on battered chairs, a pint of bitter each, and he still seems to be talking the Ian Dury talk – 'eavy, gruff, nice'n'sleazy, 'alf cockney geezer. That's the thing about his kind of acting – you can't simply pick up characters and drop them at will. Before playing King Kong, he studied gorillas in captivity at , then went to to observe them in the wild. When he played a City spiv in , he spent months working with dealers, cut off contact from his friends and had to learn to play the violin (his contribution was eventully cut down to one scene, which didn't include the violin). ""I was actually trading, and in the end they offered me a job. They said you'll be on £80,000 a year, plus bonuses."" How much was he earning then as an actor? ""Ooh, er, like, nothing."" When he and his wife to be, fellow actor , were playing lovers in in 1991 at Manchester's Royal Exchange, they decided to research their roles by meeting up for real in character and imagining their first time out together. They got off with each other, in character, and have been together ever since. As Gollum, it wasn't enough to play a troubled hobbit with a weird voice; he had to know where his pain came from. ""His voice was based on our cat coughing up fur balls,"" Serkis says. For the Dury film, he spent months walking with a heavy 70s-style calliper attached to his leg and working out only on the right side of his body."" He's been left with back pain, and a ""massive weird muscle"" has developed in his groin. ""I'm still recovering from it all."" As a young man, Serkis adored Dury – he was so witty, original and had overcome so much. Then he met him. ""He was obnoxious. We were in a Chinese restaurant and he slagged eveybody off and was just an arse, you know. And that same night, , who was one of [Dury's band] the Blockheads but was caring for him, just went, 'Fuck this, I'm not doing it any more', and he left Ian on the pavement outside the hotel."" But that's what Serkis loved about Dury – he was anything but a sanitised victim, and the film would never suggest he was. ""I knew we weren't going to be painting a glorified picture of a stoic underdog, it was going to be warts and all. And when we started showing early drafts to Sophie and Baxter [Dury's second wife and oldest son], they were like, 'He's so much darker, so much more of a cunt than this. You've got to get down and dirty with this.' So we thought, great, if they're prepared to take off the boxing gloves, so will we."" Whenever he takes on a character, he looks for what they have in common, and Serkis, 45, says the two men share a near obsessive drive to fulfil themselves creatively. ""Ian knows there's only a certain amount of time we have on this planet, and if you've got a family, there are going to be casualties. There isn't a moral to the story, but it's like, be magnificent in the short amount of time you've got. And I think I live my life by that code, but we also have real life to deal with. Where the Venn diagram crosses over between me and Ian is wanting to do the very best you can in the short space of time you've got, but give everything you can equally to the people you love and who are your life. That's a really difficult thing."" It seems to be a conflict very much at the heart of Serkis's life. He and Lorraine have three children; he loves chasing them round the house, playing monsters, and is desperately aware that he is not there for them as often as he would like to be. (He spent nearly two years in New Zealand shooting Lord Of The Rings, and is soon off again to shoot .) And sometimes, he says, even when he is there, he isn't really because he's lost in a character. ""You're watching your kids playing football and you're not present. It's like the worst… it's horrible. I despise myself for it."" He says it with a quiet, shocking intensity, stands up and gets the next round in. ""I think it's a particularly male thing. Being present and in the moment with your kids is something a lot of men struggle with."" We're talking politics and compromise. He's no longer in the SWP, but still thinks of himself as being on the left. At the 2003 Oscars, he brought along for company a banner. He and Lorraine recently argued about education – he believes in state education, she favours private. Lorraine won. As he worried that his mind was not open enough in his SWP days, he now worries that his mind is too open. He tells me how he tried to get into the head of Moors murderer Ian Brady. ""When I played him, I thought, what's the most beautiful thing that's happened in my life? Well, it was witnessing my three children being born at home in a birthing pool in my living room, and I thought, well, for Ian Brady, the most beautiful thing must have been taking life away from a child."" A chill runs through my veins. That's horrible, I say. Serkis nods. ""I know, it's a really scary thought, but if you take the role on, you have to go down that route."" Does he find at times he's unsure what he actually believes because he's borrowing a character's moral code? He smiles. ""I do listen to myself sometimes and think, is my moral compass so easily swayed by the characters I play, or is it me growing as a human being?"" He loves acting, he says, and does not intend to give it up, but he is turning more towards directing. He made a great little short film called about a prostitute (played by his wife), tattoos, a mysterious bag of money and an unwanted kidney transplant. Filmed in black and white, it is creepy and cool and disturbingly funny. Why is he focusing more on directing? Well, he says, it goes back to what we've been talking about. He would like to approach things more objectively, from a distance. He talks about the times he worked with and couldn't tell his family what he was doing because those were the rules, and found himself leading a secret double life. And if you're attracted to difficult, often unpleasant characters, of course it's going to mess with your head. ""The whole chameleon thing about acting. That's why I'm moving towards directing – it's a much more healthy occupation."" opens on January 8."	Film
6639	6640	Chambers of commerce say interest rate rise would derail recovery 	"British businesses are calling on the not to rush into an interest rate rise, warning that the recovery is not yet secure as a closely watched report on Tuesday shows a slowdown in exports. The (BCC) says its latest quarterly poll of thousands of companies shows their performance slipped on key measures such as overseas sales and investment during the last three months when compared with a strong start to 2014. The business group said its findings still pointed to a solid pace of growth for the UK, but were a reminder that the recovery was not entrenched and rebalancing the economy still had a way to run. It warned against an early move to raise borrowing costs after . ""These results reinforce the case against the Bank of England making any hasty decisions on raising interest rates in the very short-term,"" said BCC director general John Longworth. ""By driving up the cost of credit for fast-growing firms, many of whom do not sit on the same healthy cash piles as their more established counterparts, early rate rises may mean more limited growth ambitions among the very firms we are counting on to drive the recovery. ""We must nurture the business confidence we are seeing at present by giving firms the security of working in a low interest rate environment for the foreseeable future – with eventual rises both moderate and predictable."" The survey of around 7,000 companies across manufacturing and services found that on the whole businesses reported conditions above long-run trends. Its balances, which represent the number of firms reporting an improvement from those reporting a deterioration in a particular area such as orders or hiring, were mostly stronger than their 2007 pre-recession levels. But after an unusually strong first quarter, all the export and investment balances fell in the second quarter. There was a mixed picture for jobs, with the balance deteriorating somewhat for manufacturing although still showing employment rising in the sector. The employment expectations balance also dropped. For the much larger services sector, the jobs balance for the past three months rose but the employment expectations balance slipped back slightly. The BCC said all the survey's confidence balances remained ""relatively strong"" but intentions to raise prices eased and concerns around interest rate rises rose. Interest rates have been at a record low 0.5% for more than five years and while no economists expect any action at this week's meeting of the monetary policy committee (MPC), Bank governor Mark Carney has said . After suggesting in June that a rate rise ""could happen sooner than markets currently expect"" and then days later downplaying chances of a move anytime soon, Carney has faced criticism for baffling businesses and financial markets. Some critics say the governor has effectively killed off his own ""forward guidance"" scheme, designed to give businesses clarity over the interest rate outlook. The BCC's chief economist David Kern said it was vital the Bank went back to sending clearer messages. ""The monetary policy committee must restore the clarity of its forward guidance, and reassure business that rates will only start edging up if and when objective circumstances require such a move,"" he said."

15043	15044	West Ham: zero-tolerance if fans found guilty of antisemitic singing 	West Ham United have warned that supporters alleged to have chanted antisemitic songs on the way to could be banned for life if they are found guilty. The anti-discrimination group contacted police after video footage surfaced of a group of apparent West Ham fans singing an antisemitic song on the London Underground. The video appeared on social media and showed a group of fans chanting: “I’ve got a foreskin, how about you? Fucking Jew.” On the train on the way to the game, West Ham fans break into song in Stamford Hill,a Jewish area, scum A West Ham United spokesman said: “The club emailed every supporter who had bought a ticket to Sunday’s game to remind them that they were acting as ambassadors for . “If any individual is found to have behaved in an inappropriate way, the club’s simple, zero-tolerance policy dictates that they will face the strongest possible action, including the option of a life ban from the Boleyn Ground. “If anyone has any information on such behaviour we would urge them to report it to the Club, Kick It Out or the police so it can be investigated thoroughly.” Simon Johnson, chief executive of the Jewish Leadership Council, told the Guardian that he would like to see the club follow through on that promise if any are found to have been involved. “Any form of antisemitism is racism and therefore I support Kick It Out in their call for this matter to be investigated with the same vigour and determination as last week’s incidents with the Chelsea fans are being investigated,” he said. Tottenham also called for firm action against those responsible for Sunday’s chants. “Antisemitism in any form is wholly unacceptable and we support all efforts to kick it out of the game,” the club said. “We hope that those individuals responsible for this vile behaviour are identified and dealt with in the strongest way possible.” British Transport Police is investigating and a spokesman said: “We take these incidents very seriously and it is clear what happened on the Paris Métro and at St Pancras the following night were not isolated events.” In the build-up to the match West Ham had reminded fans attending the game of their “zero tolerance policy towards any form of discriminatory behaviour”. “We would also like to remind all fans attending the match at White Hart Lane that they will be acting as ambassadors for West Ham United and their behaviour should reflect the values and standards of our club,” read the letter which was sent to fans before the game. “Working with the Metropolitan Police, the club will continue to adopt a zero tolerance policy towards any form of discriminatory behaviour and any fan found to be acting inappropriately – including racist, antisemitic and homophobic behaviour – will be punished to the full extent of the law and banned from attending matches. “We are rightly proud of our world-famous support home and away and we look forward to the famous Claret and Blue Army once again getting behind the team with all their heart and showing the world that following the Hammers means supporting with pride, passion and respect.” Kick it Out said in a statement: “Kick It Out has received several reports via social media about the footage and will be liaising with British Transport Police on the matter. “In addition we have been informed of a number of antisemitic tweets which we are reporting to the police.” Meanwhile was overshadowed when two fans were arrested for racist chanting and throwing a smoke bomb.

3392	3393	Global markets steady despite further falls in Chinese shares 	Global markets have steadied despite a second successive day of declines in Chinese shares, as Beijing battled to rein in the stock market turmoil that has . However, the sharp moves in , coupled with bets on the first US interest rate hike since the financial crash, continued on Tuesday to send shockwaves through emerging markets – where currencies in particular came under pressure. But in Europe worries about China appeared to abate, allowing stock markets to halt a five-day losing streak. The FTSE 100 index in London closed up 0.8% at 6,555.28 points, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 rose 1%. On Wall Street, stock markets also rebounded in early trading thanks to signs that China’s share slide had eased off. On Tuesday the Shanghai Composite index initially fell more than 4% before rebounding and closing nearly 1.7% down at 3,663.82. It was another day of declines and followed Monday’s rout, when the index had its biggest one-day collapse since 2007, with a fall of 8.5%. The smaller Shenzhen index closed down 2.24% at 2,111.70, after a similarly volatile day, having plummeted by more than 7% on Monday. Bernard Aw, a market analyst at spreadbetting firm IG, said: “Things don’t look that bad today but we need to see a few more sessions to gauge whether the sharp decline of [Monday] has reached a bottom. [Wednesday] might show a clearer picture.” China’s latest stock market upset has added to wider concerns about the state of the Chinese economy and helped send the . Prices for copper, of which China is the world’s biggest consumer, fell to a six-year low on Monday. However, it staged a slight revival on Tuesday, with benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange rising 2.2% to close at $5,300 a tonne . Gold also edged up but was not far off five-and-a-half-year lows hit last week in heavy selling as investors moved out of the precious metal. While viewed as a safe asset in uncertain times, gold does not pay interest or a dividend and so is losing its shine as expectations of a interest rate hike in the US intensify. Analysts pointed to the volatility in China, the world’s top energy consumer, for oil’s tumble to six-month lows early on Tuesday. Brent crude prices managed to rebound later on but were still below $54 a barrel, having halved in price over the last year. Among emerging-market currencies, Malaysia’s ringgit and Thailand’s baht both hovered around multi-year lows against the dollar as the hot money that poured into developing economies during the years of ultra-loose US monetary policy began to flow back out. Market experts see no let-up in the selling pressure on emerging-market assets, with currencies particularly vulnerable. “Emerging currencies have been in a bear market since 2013 and prospects for a sustained recovery look poor. With emerging-market growth slipping to its weakest level since 2009, foreign capital inflows have been dwindling. Meanwhile, China’s slowdown is contributing to slow world trade growth and continued downward pressure on commodity prices, hitting emerging markets’ terms of trade,” said Adam Slater at the consultancy Oxford . Before the markets opening on Tuesday, Beijing vowed to press on with and prevent further panic. A state-controlled stock-buying agency would “continue to buy stocks to stabilise the market”, said Zhang Xiaojun, at China’s securities regulator, the CSRC. An editorial in the Shanghai Securities Daily, a state-run newspaper, said: “In the future, the market will not fall off a cliff. The government will not allow such a situation to happen again.” Beijing’s interventions appeared to have prevented a repeat sell-off on Tuesday. Patrick Chovanec, chief strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management in New York, said: “They have chosen this narrative of: ‘We are going to beat the market. We are going to essentially triumph over market forces.’” But, he said, that strategy carried serious risks for China’s Communist party leaders. “Rule number one is: you don’t want to . The answer is: let the market find its level – I don’t see why they didn’t do that in the first place. In 2007, the market collapsed by 70% and it didn’t derail the Chinese economy.” Ric Spooner, chief market analyst for CMC Markets, said Monday’s rout appeared to have been caused by Beijing withdrawing the support it had been pumping into the stock market after June’s collapse in which $3tn (£1.9tn) was wiped off the value of listed companies. That move was likely to have been executed “either to test the waters to see whether the market could withstand their absence or potentially even to try and scale back on things”, Spooner said. “It appears that that didn’t work.” Beijing has taken unprecedented steps to stave off the threat of a more severe stock market collapse in recent weeks including freezing flotations and using a state-run “ ” to pump billions of dollars into the market. But analysts warn that while such interventions might work in the short term, in the longer term they would fail. “To some extent these ‘circuit breaker’ initiatives can actually make these things a bit worse since they make things opaque, they mean that people become nervous,” said Spooner. “The very fact that the authorities are acting to do things to shore the market up creates a nervousness and it is difficult for people to know where the real value is.” Chovanec said: “The chronic issue in China is that they want a correction without having a correction. They know that the market is out of whack. They know that a correction is necessary. They know that it is unhealthy not to have a correction. But they can’t stomach the idea of actually having a real correction.”	Business
9238	9239	The Wolverine – first look review 	Bullets, bombs, critics - nothing can stop the Wolverine. Just four years after the fast-healing mutant is back. The wounds have sealed ($179m at the box office makes a good salve) and the purists are on board, wooed by the prospect of an adventure based on one of the character's best-loved comic book series: Chris Claremont and Frank Miller's Japan-set 1982 saga. Director James Mangold's take on Marvel's head boy transplants Wolverine to Tokyo, where the billionaire head of Yashida Corp, an old friend who was with Logan at the bombing of Nagasaki, is on his deathbed. He's offering Wolverine a chance at redemption. By passing on his healing power he can gain mortality and earn a chance to live as normal a life as a man with foot-long claws and indestructible metal grafted to his skeleton could ask for. Then – wouldn't you know it – the old man ups and dies too soon, leaving his granddaughter a fortune and the movie a reason to rattle on with Logan slicing 'n' dicing inheritance-hungry yakuza. Mangold, writer of and director of and , is more actors' director than action man. He likes Logan more than the Wolverine. The film's opening hour is an evenly-paced gangster thriller that toys with the character as cultural export. He's a snarling beast, adrift in a society that runs on the individual's commitment to keeping their true nature concealed. There's obvious parallels with Logan's own struggle to contain his bestial nature, at least until Mangold unsheathes the set pieces and lets the Wolverine run riot. It's here – in the middle of the roaring and cutting that we've seen rejigged many, many times before – that our interest falls to pieces. The fights are predictable, the scenery disappointingly drab considering the potential in Tokyo's neon-lit wonder-world. Wolverine's mutant foe – a slinky, acid-spitter called Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) – slides in and out of the narrative, shedding skin and goodwill with each appearance. Hugh Jackman – now on his sixth turn as the character – knows what the Wolverine needs of him. Yet there's a hint of fatigue that hours in the gym and a lock-iron perma-scowl can't fix. Wolverine's back story has become bigger and itchier with each film since Bryan Singer's ensemble movies. This time around the past is represented by some truly bizarre fantasy sequences between Jackman and Famke Janssen as Jean Grey, the lover who Logan had to sacrifice in . Janssen spends her screen time beckoning from the beyond in a swishy low cut nightie. The beyond looks like a spotlessly white villa on the dull side of Ibiza. You can understand Logan's inclination to get up and continue fighting. The X-Men films started promisingly, spun into a dive and seemed sucessfully rebooted thanks to . We're now at a point where the franchise has been snicked into strands so twisted from each other that its getting tough to trace the genealogy. The flat hammerblows of The Wolverine bear little relation to the zing and pop of Matthew Vaughn's colourful treatment. Inconsistency is inevitable in a world that's constantly being dug up and done over, but it leaves us no time to fall in love with anything being flung at us. Heroes wander in, heroes wander out. Wolverine – the indestrucible centrepiece of the buffet's spread – isn't waning, but our interest is. Here a superhero strives to be ordinary. As Marvel continues to claw the character's mystique away, he's starting to get his wish.	Film
12188	12189	Google denies YouTube Kids app unfairly targets children 	Watchdog groups have accused Google of using “unfair and deceptive marketing practices” in its Kids app, arguing the app’s video selection includes content parents would “reasonably believe their children would not be exposed to”. The complaint to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), filed Tuesday by Aaron Mackey, staff attorney for Georgetown Law’s Institute for Public Representation, argues the service blurs the line between advertising and programming for kids. “Our primary concern is that children are exposed to an endless stream of content that may not disclose that they have certain deals with product makers,” Mackey told the Guardian. “And they just pop up on the screen in front of their kids, who are going to be served a lot of ads and not know the difference.” A spokeswoman strongly rejected the assertions. “We worked with numerous partners and child advocacy groups when developing YouTube Kids. While we are always open to feedback on ways to improve the app, we were not contacted directly by the signers of this letter and strongly disagree with their contentions,” she said. Google launched the YouTube Kids app in February, describing it as “the first Google product built from the ground up with little ones in mind”. But the Center for Digital Democracy, the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and several others co-signing the complaint, argue that YouTube Kids mixes and matches advertising and programming in a way that “would not be permitted to be shown on broadcast and cable television”. The complaint is addressed to the FTC, as distinct from the Federal Communications Commission, which oversees communications including broadcasting, cable (but not digital media). While the FCC does not have jurisdiction, despite the fact that some of the programming on the service is repurposed from television, the complaint cites some of the FCC’s rules, noting that the FCC calls this kind of advertising to kids “unfair” and cites psychiatric studies demonstrating that kids lack the ability to tell advertising from programming. Those TV rules, for example, mandate “bumpers” between programs and commercials – the five-second segments that announce that the show – while YouTube Kids goes on in an uninterrupted stream. More seriously, the complaint alleges YouTube violates its own advertising guidelines: “Products related to consumable food and drinks are prohibited, regardless of nutritional content,” says the company’s and yet the stream of watchable videos (not the ads, the actual programs) includes a McDonald’s channel, complete with a video starring Mythbusters’ Grant Imahara called “ ” A small tag in the corner reads “promotional consideration provided by McDonald’s.” The complaint alleges that this counts as deceptive marketing by YouTube of the Kids app, not to kids, but to parents. The complaint also questions “unboxing” videos – user0generated videos of new products, ranging from iPhones and new toys and sneakers, being opened for the first time. Last year Google said it had received 20m searches for “unboxing.” Google, the complaint notes, “urges advertisers to ‘[c]onsider how unboxing videos might help your brand connect with consumers.’” That kind of content is much harder to regulate that something coming from an established network, or even a studio. That, the complainants say, violates the FTC’s “Guide Concerning the Use of Testimonials in Advertising” (revised as recently as last year to account for massive changes in viewership), which requires that, “[w]hen there exists a connection between the endorser and the seller of the advertised product that might materially affect the weight or credibility of the endorsement (i.e., the connection is not reasonably expected by the audience), such connection must be fully disclosed.” Regulators have become increasingly concerned about advertising aimed at children online. Last September paid $450,000 to settle a complaint with the FTC that they had violated the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act by collecting personal data without explicit parental permission. “The separation principles [between advertising and programming] don’t exist. When you’re a kid, you just think you’re watching My Little Pony 24/7,” said Mackey.	Technology
9206	9207	UK services PMI hits eight-month high 	The government was handed a last-minute election boost after the last major piece of economic news before the polls signalled a booming UK services sector, easing fears of a sharp slowdown in the wider economy. Growth in the sector, which accounts for roughly three-quarters of the UK economy and includes areas such as bars, restaurants and transport, was stronger than economists predicted, hitting an eight-month high in April. The headline index of the Markit/CIPS services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) – broadly reflecting activity in the sector – rose to 59.5 in April, from 58.9 in March, where anything above 5o signals growth. It extended the run of uninterrupted services industry growth to 28 months, the longest in seven years. David Cameron seized on the positive data, a day before the UK goes to the polls: Proof our long-term plan is working and we should stay on the road to a brighter future: UK services growth hit an 8-month high in April. The services PMI followed much weaker-than-expected equivalent surveys from the and industries, which showed parts of the economy are struggling and triggered concerns that the UK recovery was faltering. Businesses in those sectors reported customers delaying spending while uncertainty persists over the outcome of Thursday’s election. The pound rose against the dollar after the services survey was published, up 0.5% to more than $1.52, as investors were cheered by signs that the UK recovery was not about to be derailed. The pound had slumped by about 3 cents from highs late last week, as concern mounted among traders about an inconclusive election outcome. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: “Fears of the economy slumping amid election jitters are allayed as an upturn in service sector activity has helped offset sharp slowdowns in both manufacturing and construction.” Williamson said that taken together, the three PMI surveys for April suggested the economy was growing at a rate of 0.8% at the beginning of the second quarter. , much worse than expected, after the services industry was the only major sector to grow. Despite the brighter outlook suggested by the April services PMI, Williamson said there were “warning lights flashing” about the sustainability of the recovery. “Any new government is faced with the challenge of boosting business confidence and reviving investment in particular,” he added. UK growth remains heavily reliant on the consumer, despite government ambitions for a manufacturing and export-led recovery. More than six years on from the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008, the services industry is the only key sector of the UK economy where output has surpassed its pre-crisis peak. Economists said that despite the strong services PMI, there was no immediate prospect of an rise in interest rates, with inflation currently at zero. The Bank of England will announce its May policy decision on Monday.	Business
6730	6731	Ex-Co-op chief takes over at Superdry 	Euan Sutherland, , has re-emerged as the new chief executive of SuperGroup, the company behind the Superdry brand worn by David Beckham and other high-profile celebrities. Sutherland, who has been a non-executive director for two years, will take over immediately. Julian Dunkerton, the chief executive who launched the company, will take on the title of founder and product brand director. SuperGroup said Sutherland’s appointment would allow Dunkerton and the chief designer, James Holder, more time to dream up new products and protect the brand. Sutherland quit the Co-op, calling the group “ungovernable” in March after the Observer published details of his £6.6m pay deal for 2013 and 2014. The former B&Q boss attacked “an individual or individuals” for trying to undermine him. At SuperGroup, Sutherland will receive an annual salary of £675,000 plus extras that could take his first-year earnings to £3.7m subject to performance targets. Lord Myners, who wrote a report on the Co-op’s governance, . Peter Bamford, Supergroup’s chairman, said: “Euan’s appointment marks another important step in the continued evolution of SuperGroup. Euan has the stature, skills, experience and personal style to work in partnership with Julian and lead the team through the next stage of the company’s development.”	Business
7187	7188	Spotify revenues grew sharply in 2013, but operating losses also rose 	Spotify’s revenues grew sharply in 2013, but so did the streaming music company’s operating losses, as it invested heavily in global expansion, marketing and product development. The company’s latest consolidated financial results, published in Luxembourg, reveal that Spotify’s 2013 revenues of €746.9m (£592.9m) were up 73.6% from 2012’s €430.3m. However, its operating losses also rose 16.4% from just under €80m in 2012 to €93.1m in 2013. Spotify’s net losses after tax may have fallen from €86.7m in 2012 to €57.8m in 2013, but that was largely due to €38.7m of “fair value gains on derivative liability” – an accounting term relating to the value of share options. Operating losses are a clearer indication of financial trends for Spotify’s business. The consolidated results cover Spotify’s global business, including individual countries like and , where its local subsidiaries recently reported their own financial results for 2013, when both were profitable. Globally, Spotify ended 2013 with 36m active users, with more than 8m of them paying subscribers. Since then, it has grown to 50m active users and 12.5m paying subscribers – a amid its dispute with Taylor Swift. Spotify’s letter to shareholders within its 2013 results puts a bullish spin on the company’s growth. “We believe that music has mass market appeal – and as such, we believe we are just at the beginning of a much larger market opportunity. We believe our model supports profitability at scale,” it claims. “ We have already proven that we’ve created real value for our users, and we know that the more time people spend with our product, the more likely they are to become paying subscribers. We believe that we will generate substantial revenues as our reach expands, and that, at scale, our margins will improve.” That’s backed up by the company’s last few years’ of consolidated accounts, which reveal that its “cost of revenue” – mainly royalties paid out to music rightsholders – were 82.5% of its revenues in 2013, down from 90.5% in 2012 and 97.7% in 2011. However, the fact remains that has yet to break its run of annual operating losses: €21.9m in 2010, €43.1m in 2011, €80m in 2012 and €93.1m in 2013. In the latest results, Spotify’s management describes 2013 as a year when it made “a clear transition from desktop to mobile” fuelled by its launch of a free tier for its mobile apps. “Today, the majority of all new users signing up for Spotify are mobile. Making this transition from desktop to mobile means that our front door is always open,” explained the management team. “We know that a significant number of users who activate and engage on our platform convert over time to becoming paid subscribers.” As a business, Spotify is already mainly about those paid subscribers. In 2013, it made €678.7m from subscriptions and €68.2m from advertising in 2013, up 81.1% and 22.8% respectively year-on-year. Cross-referencing that with the active and paying-user figures suggests that in 2013, 90.9% of Spotify’s revenues came from the 22.2% of its users who were paying for the service. Spotify’s combination of free and paid listening is what sparked its dispute with Taylor Swift, who earlier this year after Spotify refused to let her block it from being played by free users. The company has argued that placing as few restrictions as possible on its free tier has been crucial in persuading those free users to upgrade to paid subscriptions, and fuelling Spotify’s $2bn of payments to music rightsholders since its launch in 2008. “Our free service drives our paid service,” wrote Ek earlier in November. “Here’s the key fact: more than 80% of our subscribers started as free users. If you take away only one thing, it should be this: No free, no paid, no two billion dollars.” Spotify also says that its subscriber growth has been faster in the most recent quarter (in 2014) than at any point in its history, to support its claim that more free usage is also driving more paid subscriptions. Spotify’s 2013 financial results also revealed for the first time how much the company in March 2014. “On March 10, 2014, the Group acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of The Echo Nest Corporation (“Echo Nest”), a leading music intelligence company, for approximately €55.0 million,” explained the results, backing up a report by TechCrunch at the time that . “The purchase consideration consisted of €6.6 million of cash, 61,897 shares of common stock in the Company [Spotify] and estimated share based payment awards valued at €5.4 million,” revealed the financials filing.

The Three Lions’ leveller came just moments after Claudio Marchisio had given the a goal advantage in their Group D encounter. Sturridge celebrated his close-range strike in his normal style, while Lewin jumped off the bench and injured himself in the process. The physio left the field on a stretcher after a short break in play, with the team’s Twitter official feed swiftly confirming the severity of the injury. “England physio Gary Lewin was injured during celebrations for england’s goal,” the post said. “He has dislocated his ankle.

6601	6602	Profits plunge at troubled Vatican bank as reform costs take their toll 	"The bank has announced a plunge in net profit last year after a ""painful but necessary process"" of reform saw it close thousands of accounts, wind up investments and hire expensive external experts to help with the clean-up. The long-troubled (IOR), as the bank is officially called, is preparing to enter a new era – operating under a different governance structure with a new chairman and board, to be unveiled on Wednesday. , said it was thanks to the changes made under German chairman Ernst von Freyberg that the bank was now able to move ""to a second phase of reform under new leadership"". But the financial statement for 2013, released on Tuesday, showed quite how dramatic an impact the reform had made on the bank last year, with net profit down from €86.6m (£68.8m) in 2012 to €2.9m. Results for the first six months of 2014, however, showed a net profit of €57.4m, the bank said. Among the causes of last year's plunge were ""extraordinary expenses"" related to the hiring of outside professionals such as the , a global consulting firm brought in to review accounts and tighten anti-money laundering measures, the bank said. It also blamed the ""writedown of proprietary investments in externally managed investment funds committed to between 2012 and early 2013"" – before Francis's election, totalling a loss of €28.5m. And it included in the losses a €15.1m loan made by Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican's former secretary of state and emeritus pope Benedict XVI's right-hand man, to a production company specialising in religious programmes owned by one of his acquaintances. Keen to bring an end to the whiff of scandal that has emanated sporadically from the corridors of the IOR for decades, Francis has been taking advice on how to apply his reform agenda and commitment to ethical finance to an institution whose reputation as an opaque offshore hub has often brought embarrassment to the Vatican. Earlier this year, that would not see it closed down – which had been an option – but restructured, strengthening efforts begun during Benedict XVI's papacy to bring the bank into line with anti-money laundering norms. Since last May, the bank said on Tuesday, the accounts of 2,091 clients had been blocked and around 3,000 ""customer relationships"" terminated as part of efforts to return the bank to its core role as a place for Catholic institutions and clergy to deposit their cash. Around 2,600 of those ""relationships"" concerned dormant accounts, the IOR said, while almost 400 were ended due to newly restricted clientele criteria, with a resulting outflow of €44m. A further 359 were earmarked for closure, it added. In total, the bank now has almost 15,500 clients, some of whom have more than one account, down from 18,900 in 2012. ""At the beginning of my mandate, I repeatedly said that I would proceed with zero tolerance for any suspicious activity,"" said Von Freyberg, who was appointed by Benedict XVI in the twilight of his papacy. ""We have carried out our reforms in this spirit and have not only drastically improved procedures to make the institute safer and more transparent, but have also put the institute's owner in a position to act on the basis of facts. It is fair to say that over the past months this often painful but very necessary process has opened the door to a new, unburdened future of the IOR – as a financial-service provider that is fully and solely dedicated to serving the mission of the Catholic church."" Freyberg, who worked part-time, is expected to be replaced as chairman by French businessman Jean-Baptiste de Franssu. Reports have suggested that the plan for the bank agreed on by Francis and cardinals advising him will see it stripped of its asset-management wing, and limited to providing payment services and financial advice to the church and its clients."

590	591	Standard Chartered sued over 1983 marines bombing 	"The relatives of victims of a deadly 1983 bombing of US marines in Lebanon have filed a lawsuit seeking to hold and its New York branch accountable. The families are seeking to trace assets as they try to enforce a $2.6bn (£1.7bn) judgment against Iran. They claim that the British bank conspired with and its agents to hide Iran's assets from them. A federal court in Washington DC issued the award in 2007 after Iran failed to contest claims it was involved in the bombing, which killed 241 servicemen at a marines facility in Beirut. The lawsuit in a district court in Manhattan says the bank's ""success in building a massive business clearing US dollar transactions on behalf of Iranian financial institutions was a result of concerted efforts to evade US sanctions against Iran"". It says the bank's executives ""continued year after year to process the illicit Iranian transactions in order to pad"" the bank's profits. A Standard Chartered spokeswoman, Julie Gibson, said the bank did not comment on pending litigation. This week the bank reached a with New York's financial regulator to resolve an investigation into whether it schemed with the Iranian government to launder money. The deal subjects the bank's New York branch to two years of monitoring. Standard Chartered said on Monday that it strongly rejected the regulator's portrayal of its transactions with Iranian banks. It said ""well over 99.9%"" of the questioned transactions with Iran complied with all regulations, and the few transactions that did not amounted to $14m. It said none of its Iranian payments were on behalf of any designated terrorist group."	Business
273	274	'Unhappy' Torres to discuss his Chelsea future after 'ups and downs' 	" has admitted that winning a first European Cup has made up for the toils he has endured since swapping Liverpool for Chelsea for a British record fee of £50m, though the striker tempered that sense of relief by stressing he will not be satisfied with a bit-part role in the side next season. The forward, who will travel to Ibiza on holiday on Monday before the announcement of Spain's squad for Euro 2012, has added FA Cup and winners' medals to the World Cup and European championship versions he has claimed with his national team. Yet Torres has played second fiddle to Didier Drogba in Chelsea's two finals this term, coming on after 84 minutes against Bayern Munich having been an unused substitute against his former club, Liverpool, at Wembley earlier this month. The 28-year-old was ecstatic in victory yet conceded his omission from the starting lineup at the Allianz Arena was ""the biggest disappointment"" of his life, with the striker further irked at not being asked to take a penalty in the shootout even if the triumph secured by Drogba's spot‑kick offered considerable consolation. ""In the end I was able to play a bit and help the team but there was huge disappointment when I saw the starting lineup, maybe the biggest disappointment of my life,"" Torres said. ""This season I felt things I had never felt [before]. I felt they have treated me in a way I was not expecting; not in the manner for which the club brought me here. ""We have had many conversations and, now the season has finished, we will have more talks to see what happens because this is not the role for which I came. I'm not happy. All this makes up for it, of course, but as far the future is concerned, well, football has been fair to me. Right now I do feel it's all worth it but the truth is I've gone through some very bad moments. ""The worst moments of my career have come during this season and I am not willing to relive those moments. There have been ups and downs, and moments where I've felt lost and didn't know what to do or where to be. I want to thank my family, the club's owner, who's always supported me and backed me, and, above all, the fans. If it wasn't for the fans many times this season I would have thrown in the towel."" This was Torres's first full campaign at the club and, while he showed flashes of his pedigree – a hat-trick against Queens Park Rangers catching the eye, together with his stunning late goal at Camp Nou in the Champions League semi-final – it had become clear long before the season's finale that he was very much an alternative, rather than partner, to Drogba. The Ivorian has now managed nine goals in nine cup finals as a player and, in the system preferred by Roberto Di Matteo, his selection was always likely to leave Torres initially on the bench. It remains to be seen whether Drogba will be retained at Stamford Bridge beyond the expiry of his contract next month, though Chelsea's policy – either in the transfer market or in contract negotiations – will now have implications for Torres. The European club champions have already been linked with Radamel Falcao of Atlético Madrid, Hulk of Porto and Napoli's Edinson Cavani, meaning it would arguably take a change of formation to accommodate Torres in a first-choice lineup. Realisation of as much will prompt him to seek assurances. ""The ideal for me for next season is if someone tells me what's going to happen,"" Torres said. ""What role will I have in the team? What function? What is expected of me? And then I have to evaluate if it is worth it. You will see me in London celebrating with everyone and then on Monday in Ibiza. I'm waiting for the announcement of the Spain squad hoping I will be in it feeling better than ever and with greater desire than ever. ""I came to this club to win the Champions League. I've now won the Euros, the World Cup and the Champions League. Right now I have next season a very important game for me emotionally, the European Super Cup against Atlético Madrid and I am already counting the days for it to arrive. But to have won this makes us all so happy. For the players, the people and because this club had the ambition to win this trophy and finally did it."""	Football
2687	2688	Theresa May says she wants to clamp down on EU citizens coming to UK 	"The home secretary, , has said she wants a clampdown on the way EU citizens are permitted to come to the UK, but avoided confirming leaks coming from her department suggesting she wants a cap of 75,000 EU workers. At present the government cannot impose a limit on the number of EU citizens coming to the country because of the free movement of workers. May refused to confirm the leaks, but said: ""There is a growing concern about the abuse of free movement in the EU."" She added that this was not something that was just being raised in the UK. She pointed out that the law had originally allowed free movement only of workers, but partly because of court judgments this had been extended to EU citizens. She was speaking amid fears of a large-scale Tory rebellion over the lifting of restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians coming to Britain on 1 January. David Davis, the former shadow home secretary, has joined the revolt, calling for the government to tell the EU that the deadline for allowing Romanians and Bulgarians should be put back a further two years. A vote in the Commons is due in the new year, but has been postponed by government whips. May confined most of her remarks on the BBC Today programme to tighter rules on the free movement of new accession countries rather existing member states. The reported proposal reflects increasing tensions within the party over how to deal with the electorate's concerns about immigration. Rows between Tories over are expected to escalate in the new year as MEPs, MPs and councillors seek ways of stopping the rise of the UK Independence party, which has gained popularity because of its hardline stance on EU immigration. Ukip is widely expected to gain seats in May's European and local elections. The document, drawn up by the Home Office and seen by the Sunday Times, reportedly says unlimited immigration from the EU has damaged the job prospects of low-skilled Britons, encouraged benefit tourism, put pressure on public services and caused the ""build-up of social tensions"". It suggests a range of measures to cut immigration, including a cap of 75,000 migrants a year and tougher employment criteria. Davis, the former shadow home secretary, said on Sunday the review was ""closing the stable door after the horse has bolted"". ""On 1 January the accession period comes to an end for Bulgaria and Romania and they will then have free movement of people, the same rights of movement as anybody else in Europe. There are huge fears that there will be thousands, tens of thousands, if you believe Ukip hundreds of thousands, of people coming into Britain,"" he told BBC's Andrew Marr Show. ""So it needs to be dealt with straight away. It needs to be dealt with by saying to the EU: 'We're sorry, this can't work. Let's just rethink this, put it off for a couple of years and rethink it'."" A cap on EU immigration would require a renegotiation of Britain's links with Europe, something David Cameron has promised to do if he is re-elected in 2015. In a further development, a group of Tory backbench MPs have written to Cameron asking for an immediate national veto over all EU laws. According to the Mail on Sunday, the MPs write: ""This proposal would enable the government for example to recover control over our borders, to lift EU burdens on business, to regain control over energy policy and to disapply the EU charter of fundamental human rights."" Also speaking on The Andrew Marr Show, the shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, stressed the importance of stopping migrant workers undercutting their British counterparts. He said: ""We were very clear, and we raised this issue with the home secretary over eight months ago, that you have to have proper transitional controls in place. So what will happen in respect of people coming in from Bulgaria, Romania, wanting to claim out-of-work benefits, housing benefit, jobseeker's allowance, for example? ""So will that come in and will the restrictions they are talking about come in in January? No indication so far. ""To the extent that people do come in and they can show that they can work and bring economic activity, here are appropriate measures being implemented to stop them undercutting British workers, but also to stop them being exploited by employers. ""For example, by ensuring you have proper enforcement of the national minimum wage and increasing the fines 10-fold as we have suggested."" He also called for a properly balanced debate on the issue, saying migration had brought a lot of benefits to Britain."	Politics
9882	9883	Rich list: more than 100 billionaires in Britain for the first time 	The number of billionaires living in Britain has risen to more than 100 for the first time, a study has found. Some 104 billionaires are now based in the UK – more than triple the number from a decade ago – with a combined wealth of more than £301bn, according to the Sunday Times rich list. It means Britain has more billionaires per head of population than any other country, while London's total of 72 sterling billionaires is more than any other city in the world, the study found. Indian-born brothers Sri and Gopi Hinduja top the list of the UK's wealthiest billionaires with a fortune of £11.9bn. The London-based pair, who run the global conglomerate Hinduja Group, saw their wealth rise by £1.3bn in the last year, the study found. They replaced Russian business magnate at the top after the Arsenal shareholder's fortune fell to £10.65bn, the list said. The richest Briton, the Duke of Westminster, is ranked 10th on the list after his fortune rose to £8.5bn. Last year, 88 billionaires were living in the UK, worth a total of more than £245bn, according to the list. In 2004, the number of billionaires in Britain was 30, with a combined wealth of £65bn, it said. Among the new members of the billionaire club is West End producer Sir , whose fortune rose by £175m in the past year and is now worth £1bn, the survey found. Plymouth-born Chris Dawson, who owns and runs The Range discount store chain, increased his fortune by £695m in the past 12 months to net £1.28bn. Jon Hunt, founder of the estate agents Foxtons, has a £1.07bn fortune, up £145m in 2013, the list said. Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley and Sir Richard Branson are among the UK's top 25 wealthiest billionaires. Sir Brian Souter and Ann Gloag, the siblings who founded the Stagecoach transport empire, share a fortune of £1bn – an increase of £270m on last year. The wealthiest new entry is Carrie and Francois Perrodo and their family, who own the London-based Perenco oil and gas operation and are said to be worth £6.14bn. It is the first time since 2008 that the minimum wealth of the 50 richest people in the country has exceeded £1.5bn, according to the list. A decade ago, a personal fortune of £700m was needed to be among Britain's 50 wealthiest people. The entry point to the UK top 50 on the list is now £1.7bn. The combined wealth of the Britain's super rich is now ahead of the pre-recession levels of 2008, when the total wealth of the UK's 75 billionaires was £201bn. 	Business
8563	8564	At the risk of sounding like a trendy vicar, register to vote 	 moved house four months ago, to what turned out to be a safe-seat constituency. It’s embarrassingly safe, in fact – the have held this seat without interruption since 1931 and, in two-thirds of the elections since then, have gained more than 50% of the vote. Even calling it a safe seat seems like a colossal understatement. With three weeks to go, the results of the general election have already been strapped down and locked up and carved in stone. Everybody already knows who’s going to win, even the other candidates. That’s why nobody bothers to campaign here any more. So far, I’ve only received one leaflet from our Ukip candidate, using a carpark ticket machine – as if to demonstrate his all-powerful dominion over the machines. The Green candidate knocked on my door at 2pm one Tuesday afternoon, and looked so startled to get a response that she essentially just ran away after about five seconds. And that’s it. To campaign here would be to spaff precious time and resources down the toilet. So the instinct would be not to vote. Not to even register to vote. Because, really, what’s the point? The result is a foregone conclusion. It’d be pointless to expect change if I wanted change and, if I wanted to maintain the status quo, everyone else would maintain it for me. I may as well just spend the whole of 7 May in my pants, eating Pringles and playing Grand Theft Auto. And yet, despite all the logic to the contrary, I’ve registered to vote. Call me an idiot, but you never know. Perhaps Ukip will slice the rightwing vote in two, leaving the nearest left-leaning candidate open to exploit the schism. Perhaps my vote can make that happen. And perhaps the 35% of people in this town who haven’t voted in a general election for 20 years will magically register to vote, and vote in May, and vote the same way that I do, and together we’ll edge out all those decades of complacency. You never know. Monday is the last day that you can register to vote for this election. You may have already noticed this because Twitter has gone into full-blown condescension mode. Every third person who tweets anything today has inexplicably taken on the persona of a fully annoying trendy vicar, dripping in unearned sanctimony as they tell you how, like, voting’s really cool. These people are all uniformly terrible, and you’re right to hate them. And it’s not even like you should believe them, because voting isn’t cool. Voting’s a massive bloody chore. You walk for half an hour, go into a room that smells vaguely of death, scratch a thing with a bit of paper and then walk all the way home again. Voting is rubbish. The only time that voting isn’t rubbish is when your polling station is a primary school, and you can go use one of the tiny urinals while screaming “I AM A TERRIFYING GIANT!” at your own genitals. That’s fun. But, despite all this, you should still register to vote. You never know. I live in a constituency so safe that I may as well ball up my ballot paper, push it up my bum and spend the afternoon farting it out at pigeons. But I’ve still registered to vote, because you never know. Statistically, if you’re reading this, you probably have a much better chance of affecting change than I do, so you should definitely register. It’s a ballache, it’s a long shot, and I hate myself for joining the trendy vicar brigade, but register to vote. You never know.	Politics

6911	6912	Growing alarm as foreigners flock in for great British takeaway 	"Jaguar, Tetley and Corus steel. Great British companies? Not really. The prime minister may be driven around in a Jag, but the car firm, along with Tetley and Corus, is run by Ratan Tata, the Indian chairman of Motors. Jaguar has prospered under foreign ownership. Sales are up by 100,000 vehicles to almost 360,000 – 80% of them overseas. And with greater sales has come continued investment in UK plants and jobs. That, however, is not necessarily the norm with a foreign takeover. it promised to keep its Somerdale factory in Somerset open. Just a week after the purchase, Cadbury's new American owners lamented that, in fact, Somerdale would need to close after all. Market forces, you see. The debate about foreign takeovers has been stoked again by Pfizer's unsuccessful attempt to buy , the British-based pharmaceutical group, for nearly £70bn. Following the outcry over the possible deal, and the fear of UK job losses, the business secretary, Vince Cable, promised to strengthen Britain's takeover rules, to make it harder for international bidders to renege on promises made during a deal. The government will consult on the changes, and new laws are set to be introduced before the general election in 2015. In the 1980s, the Americans arrived. Margaret Thatcher deregulated the City and Merrill Lynch, Chase Manhattan and Lehman Brothers, to name a few, snapped up ancient institutions, replacing the clubby atmosphere of the Square Mile with the rapacious, bonus-grabbing culture that has dominated the financial centre ever since. An influx of capital to London ensured it pulled clear of continental rivals as the place for the big beasts of the financial services sector to do business. When the sub-prime mortgage model went bust in the US, though, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. Merrill Lynch, AIG, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, HBOS, Royal Bank of Scotland, Bradford & Bingley, Fortis, Hypo and Alliance & Leicester all came within a whisker of doing so, and had to be rescued. America's problems hit nowhere harder than London. ""We know a little of the history at City and while we want to bring in the best players in the world, we also want to see the academy continue to develop talent and want to give Mark Hughes [the manager] the chance to bring homegrown players into the team,"" said Sheik Mansour, a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family, on the day the family purchased football club five years ago. Eighteen months later, Hughes, a former Welsh international, was sacked. City made it through to the last 16 of the Champions League last season, for the first time in their history, only to play an 11 against CSKA Moscow that didn't contain a single English, or home nation, player. Across the Premier League, the proportion of homegrown players has dropped to around a third, while 11 out of 20 clubs have foreign owners. Talking to a House of Lords select committee last year, the chief executive of the Premier League, Richard Scudamore, insisted that were no grounds for concern about the domestic league. ""There is a huge association with it being quintessentially English,"" Scudamore said. ""The overseas owners and players buy into that. They are buying something very authentic, something that has been there since 1888. David Cameron talks about Britain being open for business. If this country does business overseas, these people have to be able to do business here."" When the Tories unveiled Jim Messina, the electoral strategist behind Barack Obama's victories, as their new star consultant, many a Labour nose was put out of joint. ""We'll have someone similar soon enough,"" insisted a senior Ed Miliband aide. This spring the British political career of David Axelrod, known as 'the Axe', another of Obama's strategists, was launched on a reported six-figure salary. Yet, if pay is any indicator of value, it is Lynton Crosby (centre right), the Australian who masterminded four consecutive national election victories for John Howard, the former Australian prime minister, who will decide the 2015 election in Britain as David Cameron's top political problem solver - on a salary of £500,000. It is said that Cameron's recent cabinet reshuffle was actually a Crosby operation. His genius, it is also said, is in ousting unpopular ministers. All this may go to prove that there's a dearth of British talent in the world of strategy, but is there something about a foreign accent that suggests infinite knowledge and wisdom? Remember straining to find hidden meaning in Sven-Göran Eriksson's (bottom right) take on his England team's performances. ""First half good, second half not so good,"" he sagely pronounced, justifying every penny of his £3m after-tax pay packet. Three years ago, it was revealed that of the 62 apartments sold at One Hyde Park – the world's most expensive residential block, pictured above - just nine had been registered for council tax. The foreign owners assumed that such a levy wasn't for them. Nearly half (25) of the flats had companies in the British Virgin Islands as their registered owners. Other offshore tax havens used to purchase the properties include Guernsey, the Cayman Islands, Liechtenstein and Liberia. One Hyde Park, built by the Candy brothers, is just the most extreme example of this trend in London. Wealthy foreign investors, seeking a safe berth for their cash, have been stoking a property boom, driving up prices and locking millions of UK citizens out of the housing market. A recent report from the thinktank Civitas, entitled Finding Shelter, cites statistics showing that 85% of prime London property purchases in 2012 were made with overseas money. Estate agent Savills found that last year £7bn of international money was spent on ""high-end"" London homes. Two-thirds of homes bought by people from overseas were purchased not for owner-occupation, but as investments. An Englishman's word is his bond. David Cameron confirmed last week that he will play tennis with the wife of a former ally of Vladimir Putin, after the Conservatives said they will keep a £160,000 donation raised by auctioning the game. The prime minister rejected calls to pay back the cash – from Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of a former member of president Putin's government during the early part of the last decade. Cameron said that, given recent events in Ukraine, he could not possibly accept money from a ""Putin crony"", but fortunately Mrs Chernukhin's husband, Vladimir ,""certainly wasn't that"". Chernukhin had bid for a tennis match with Cameron and Boris Johnson, the London mayor, at fundraising dinner, and the outcome of the auction had to be respected, Tory officials insisted. Johnson was less adamant - though it appears that he has now relented under pressure from Downing Street. ""I know about this tennis match,"" he said. ""They volunteered me to play tennis with some geezer, and it's very, very important that full checks are carried out to ensure this is not someone who is an intimate of Putin or a crony, and we are doing that at the moment."" This story was amended on 27 July. The Cadbury deal was worth £12bn, not £1.8bn as we stated"	Business
11213	11214	Jeremy Corbyn appoints ally John McDonnell as shadow chancellor 	Jeremy Corbyn, the new Labour leader, is facing the first test of his ability to lead the parliamentary party after appointing his closest political ally, , as shadow chancellor. The decision means that the five most senior positions will be filled by men, including as shadow home secretary, Hilary Benn as shadow foreign secretary, and Tom Watson as elected deputy as well as Corbyn and McDonnell. Corbyn’s biggest problem may now be the fierce resistance within the parliamentary party and even among some union leaders to the appointment of McDonnell, with some asking Corbyn to appoint as shadow chancellor, to balance the shadow cabinet politically and by gender. Eagle was instead given the business portfolio and will also become shadow first secretary of state, deputising for Corbyn in the Commons. McDonnell was Corbyn’s leadership campaign manager and has advocated nationalisation without compensation in the past as well as 60p tax rates. Among MPs, his appointment was seen as a disavowal of Corbyn’s commitment to create a political consensus. Charles Clarke, a former home secretary, said on Monday that he was “aghast” at the appointment of McDonnell, and took it as an indication that Corbyn was appointing hard-left allies instead of building a broad shadow cabinet. He told the BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme that he thought centrist MPs would probably begin to form their own shadow Treasury policy within the party. Gisela Stuart, a Labour MP who sits on the intelligence and security committee, told the same programme that Corbyn was “not taking the party to 2020” and the party needed to debate what it stood for, which would create conflict. Another brewing political row in the party is over its Europe policy, as former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said he was leaving the frontbench by mutual agreement because he could not secure an unambiguous promise from Corbyn to campaign for the UK to stay in the EU. However, Benn, the new shadow foreign secretary, insisted he knew that Corbyn would campaign for Britain to fight to stay in the EU “under all circumstances”. Corbyn’s first challenge in the House of Commons on Monday will be Labour’s response to the trade union bill, led by Eagle, which the whole party strongly opposes so he is unlikely to see any defiance of the whip. In further appointments, was made shadow secretary of state for international development, Seema Malhotra will be shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, and Heidi Alexander, a relatively new MP, is the new shadow health secretary. Alexander, a former whip, has helped establish the “Red Shift” group set up in the wake of the election defeat, calling for the party to show that it understood that “money did not grow on trees”. The existing shadow justice secretary, Lord Falconer, an ally of Burnham and one-time Blairite, will remain shadow lord chancellor. The lack of high-profile jobs for women went down badly with many. The Labour MP for Hull North, Diana Johnson, tweeted: It is so very disappointing - old fashioned male dominated Labour politics in the top positions in Shadow Cabinet Both Harriet Harman as deputy leader and as shadow home secretary have stood down. Cooper will head a taskforce examining the refugee crisis. Benn defended the appointments, saying it was “old-fashioned” to view the biggest jobs as leader, chancellor, home secretary and foreign secretary. He said shadow international development, handed to Abbott, was also extremely important, especially given the refugee crisis. Watson, elected deputy leader on Saturday, said on Sunday that he thought Labour must support remaining in Europe and stressed that he supported a renewal of the Trident nuclear submarine system, a position Corbyn has rejected for a decade and had made a centrepiece of his triumphant leadership campaign. After a day – and night – at Westminster huddled with advisers, including the reappointed shadow chief whip, Rosie Winterton, Corbyn faced a slow drip of ministerial resignations and then, late in the evening, moved to stabilise the parliamentary party by making a series of appointments. Alongside Corbyn and Watson’s own election, the quintet now at the top of the party is entirely male. McDonnell, an hour before the announcement of his new position wa made, shared a platform with Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister, at a TUC fringe meeting. He defended the appointments that were soon to be declared. “I am hoping that within the hour we will have a shadow cabinet put together. As you know, that has been slightly more challenging than the traditional shadow cabinet. It will be as broad-based as we could possibly make it and as inclusive as possible,” he said. McDonnell, the former head of finance at the GLC under Ken Livingstone, quipped that some people were already trying to compare him to Varoufakis because of his anti-austerity views: “Someone said to me ‘are you going to be Britain’s Yanis Varoufakis?’ And I said, ‘I could never be that cool,’” he said, to laughter from a supportive audience. Regarding the trade union bill, which will go before the Commons on Monday, McDonnell said he and Corbyn would “expect” Labour MPs to vote against it during its second reading in parliament and would convene a conference for those who oppose austerity across Europe. He refused to say whether a Corbyn-McDonnell administration would support or reject withdrawal from the EU. “Jeremy has made it clear is that what we should be working with parties across Europe for is a reform package across Europe itself. Whatever [David] Cameron comes back with, we will have to assess what that is. If it is any attack on employment rights or the promotion of TTIP [Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership], we will be rejecting that package but we will have to come up with a reform programme as well. Jeremy has not supported withdrawal but has not given Cameron a free pass on it,” he said.	Politics
11268	11269	Merkel suggests a deal can be reached over Cameron's EU demands 	 has received a boost to his EU renegotiation plans after Angela Merkel left the door open to revising the Lisbon treaty to accommodate British demands. On the final stage of the prime minister’s two-day tour of four European capitals, the German chancellor adopted an emollient tone as she expressed the hope that a deal could be agreed with Britain. “Wherever there is a desire, there is also a way, and this should be our guiding principle here,” Merkel said after talks at the German chancellery in Berlin. Cameron travelled to Berlin after one of his central demands – banning EU migrants from claiming in-work benefits for four years – was given a frosty reception in Warsaw by his Polish counterpart, Ewa Kopacz. The Polish prime minister, who faces a tough general election in the autumn and is unlikely to cave in to Britain, accused Cameron of tabling discriminatory proposals targeted at Poles. Cameron is understood to have tried to reassure Kopacz that his plans would not discriminate against Polish citizens because they would apply to all EU migrants. But the penalising of EU citizens enjoying the freedom to work in the UK is one of the most controversial and also most substantive items on the prime minister’s shopping list. British officials working on Cameron’s renegotiation plan accept that his plans to restrict access to in-work benefits for EU migrants is emerging as one of the most difficult items. Government lawyers have advised No 10 that the changes would have to be underpinned in the Lisbon treaty to ensure that the UK could not be taken to the European court of justice for breaching the EU’s rules on the free movement of people. It is understood that British officials will argue that it is difficult to accuse the UK of discriminating against EU citizens by denying them the same access to tax credits as British citizens, because of differences between welfare systems across the EU. Other EU states have contributory welfare systems which means that UK citizens working in some EU countries are denied access to some benefits. The atmosphere on Cameron’s tour improved when he flew from Warsaw to Berlin for talks with Merkel who will be the central figure in the negotiations that will take place round the table of the European council of EU leaders. She said she accepted his call for the EU to recognise that some member states do not feel comfortable with greater European integration, as she acknowledged there was a two-speed . Merkel suggested that she might be open to revising the Lisbon treaty. Government lawyers have advised Cameron, who has spoken of the need for “full-on” treaty change, that he will need to underpin his benefit changes in a revised treaty. But the German chancellor made clear that it was important to agree on the substance of reform before deciding on the mechanism for delivering the change. Merkel said: “It is worth talking about the content, the substance. We also need to talk about what needs to be changed. Is it necessary to change the treaty? Can it be changed via a secondary process? But, of course, if you are convinced of a content, of a substance, then we shouldn’t be saying, well, to change the treaty is totally impossible.” Merkel made clear that she hoped Britain would remain in the EU, though she said it was a matter for UK voters to decide in the referendum that is to be held by the end of 2017. Cameron was greeted with a full military guard of honour and a red carpet in Berlin. Over a working lunch of shrimp tartare, veal escalope, asparagus and potatoes, followed by strawberries, the two discussed the issues that will appear on the agenda of the G7 meeting next week and thrashed out their differences and commonalities over European reform. Merkel faces a balancing act between fighting to keep in the EU a Britain that is seen as recalcitrant and ungrateful by most Germans, while appearing not to concede to its demands. If a Brexit were to happen on her watch, those close to her cautiously admit that she would consider it one of the failures of her tenure as German chancellor. Cameron said he was confident he would eventually renegotiate Britain’s EU membership terms. “Of course there is no magic big solution,” he said. “But as the chancellor has said previously and again today: where there is a will, there is a way. The EU has shown before that when one of its member states has a problem that needs sorting out it can be flexible enough to do so. I have every confidence it will do so again. The EU is better off with the UK as a member and I believe that the British national interest can best be served by staying in the EU on the basis of a reformed settlement.”	Politics
14056	14057	MPs urge Britain’s retailers to boycott Black Friday 	MPs have urged Britain’s retailers to boycott Black Friday, attacking the demand on police resources caused by the US-inspired sales bonanza that saw across the country as . Greg Mulholland, the Lib Dem MP for Leeds North West, criticised major chains for adopting the discount day and sympathised with police officers who said they had “enough to do already”. Incidents included people fighting over televisions at Asda in Wembley and officers intervening after 200 people refused to leave a Tesco Extra store in the Manchester area despite being told it was sold out. The promotional day did not boost the total amount of sales, profits or number of parcels delivered over Christmas above the level already expected, according to research by online retailers assocation IMRG. It squeezed huge numbers of orders into a few days, putting unprecedented pressure on delivery systems. £810m was spent online on last year, the biggest ever day for UK online sales. “It was a tsunami situation, sales slid back before it hit and subsided afterwards,” said Andrew Starkey, head of e-logistics for IMRG. Nearly a fifth of all online sales rung up in the eight weeks to 27 December occurred in the week of Black Friday, a total of £3.7bn, with the volume of items ordered on the late November weekend at least 30% ahead of expectations, according to analysis with advisory firm Capgemini. “It caught the public’s imagination and retailers’ imagination and suddenly everyone was on the case,” said Starkey. The researchers forecast shoppers would spend 12% more online, taking sales to £116bn through the year. Starkey warned that retailers would have to come up with tactics, such as spreading deliveries over a longer period or making click & collect services more appealing, in order to cope with a similar spike in demand this year. “There’s no economic way retailers can reserve capacity all year for just that weekend. That’s the challenge for the industry,” he said. Earlier this month, Andy Street, the boss of John Lewis, called on fellow retailers to and ensure the day was focused on electrical goods rather than becoming a widespread discounting event affecting fashion, homeware and other categories. Conservative former minister Sir Peter Bottomley backed Mulholland in urging UK retailers to boycott the event from now on. But Craig Wheeler, a director of beauty products website Feelunique.com, said he was planning for sales to be twice as big. Alex Baldock, group chief executive of Shop Direct, the owner of the Littlewoods and Very brands, said the company had already begun talks with suppliers about this year’s event as he expected another step up in Black Friday fever. “We think it’s certainly here to stay and we will make a lot of it in 2015,” he said. “It is perfectly possible to prosper on Black Friday if you are a good trader, can negotiate good deals and are well prepared months in advance,” he said. Shop Direct enjoyed its busiest trading day ever last year with orders at its Very.co.uk brand up 134% compared to a year before. Baldock said the event helped Shop Direct take market share and enjoy a 4% rise in total sales for the seven weeks to 26 December despite an 11% fall in sales at its traditional catalogue brands Littlewoods and K&Co.

14753	14754	JD Salinger documentary gets first screening at Cannes 	"t has been veiled in mystery and speculation, and has been nine years in the making. But now a few minutes of the highly anticipated documentary about JD Salinger by Shane Salerno – chiefly known as a writer of action films including Savages and Alien vs Predator – has been shown at the . Through a bafflingly fast-paced montage of clips, showing fragments of interviews with figures such as Tom Wolfe, EL Doctorow and the late Gore Vidal, the preview hinted at, rather than delivered, revelations about the writer's existence after he withdrew from public life in 1965, living in seclusion and no longer publishing though, it is speculated, writing feverishly until his death in 2010. Asked whether the film, which is due for release in the autumn, contained any hard revelations about The Catcher in the Rye author's reclusive life, Harvey Weinstein, whose Weinstein Company is handling the movie, said, ""It depends how you define a great revelation. I hope the audience will keep the secret of the film, and won't tell their neighbours, just like they did for The Crying Game. If I told you what it was they'd kill me. Shane Salerno directed Savages, so I am definitely not going to tell you."" The preview contained enigmatic references to the ""huge bunker"" in which Salinger apparently wrote; ""the biggest secret of his lifetime""; ""two thick manuscripts"" and an interviewee tearfully referring to ""the saddest thing I have ever read"". There were also hints about the mental aftermath of his serving in the war and the psychological effect of his most famous work having been adduced as an influence on a number of high-profile murderers, most famously Mark David Chapman, who shot John Lennon, and who was found with a copy of the novel inscribed with the words ""This is my statement"". On a personal note, Weinstein revealed that he had repeatedly written to Salinger (""one letter, then another letter, then about 50 letters"") asking for permission to make The Catcher in the Rye into a film. Through the documentary, he learned that he was ""about 9,000th in line"" with Elia Kazan ""at number one"" and ""Mike Nicholls also in high consideration"". Salinger authorised no film adaptations of his stories after an unsatisfactory version of his Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut, transformed into My Foolish Heart (1949) by director Mark Robson. Weinstein showed the taster from Salinger along with a number of other forthcoming films on his slate, notably an adaptation of Nelson Mandela's autobiography Long Walk to Freedom, starring British actor Idris Elba and directed by Justin Chadwick. A few moments' footage suggested a film that will not shy away from the violence and terror of the ANC leader's struggle. Weinstein said, ""This is not the baddies' HBO version of Mandela – this is the truth. It's an amazing story told in a really tough way, the warts and all story of Mandela and the end of apartheid."" Weinstein also showed clips from One Chance, starring James Corden as an aspiring opera singer, based on the life of the Bristolian Paul Potts who won Britain's Got Talent in 2007 with a performance of Nessun Dorma. He also unveiled a preview of Tracy Letts' film adaptation of his play August Osage County, with an ensemble cast including Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts and Benedict Cumberbatch. Nicole Kidman introduced scenes from her forthcoming biopic Grace of Monaco, in which the actor-princess struggles to adapt to her role as European royalty against a backdrop of diplomatic tension between the principate and France."

13150	13151	Nokia's handset business bought by Microsoft for €5.44bn 	" has swooped in to buy the handset business of Finland's Nokia, an audacious move that confirms the Redmond software company's intention to compete with Apple and Google head-on as a ""devices and services"" business. The deal, for €5.44bn (£4.6bn), gives Microsoft a company which used to dominate the mobile and smartphone market in 2006 but has been overshadowed by the rise of Apple and, latterly, Samsung and companies using Google's software. For , it means that a decades-long heritage as one of the world's leading mobile phone makers - which had been a source of huge pride in Finland - is over. As part of the deal Stephen Elop, now Nokia's chief executive, will rejoin Microsoft, which he left in September 2010 to take over the then-struggling Finnish company. Elop, 49, has been tipped as a leading contender to become the next chief executive of Microsoft, after the announcement at the end of August by Steve Ballmer that he would depart within 12 months. A total of 32,000 Nokia staff will join Microsoft, including 4,700 based in Finland. Microsoft is also providing €1.5bn of ""immediate financing"" to Nokia, implying that the Finnish company has hit a cash crunch. Its debt has already been reduced to ""junk"" status. If used, the loan will be repayable when the deal closes. ""For Nokia, this is an important moment of reinvention and from a position of financial strength, we can build our next chapter,"" said Risto Siilasmaa, chairman of the Nokia Board of Directors, who now takes over as the interim chief executive of the remaining parts of Nokia. Those are Nokia Siemens Networks, which builds mobile phone infrastructure and its HERE mapping platform. The NSN and mapping business are now just over 50% of revenues, and barely profitable. Elop recently completed the acquisition of 50% of NSN that was owned by Siemens. But even inside cash-rich Microsoft, Nokia's phone business faces serious challenges. Its handset business has slumped in size from a peak in the third quarter of 2010, with revenues of €7.2bn, to just €2.72 in the second quarter of this year, its smallest size in more than a decade. It has also been lossmaking for five of the past six quarters. While it is strong in the ""feature phone"" business in the developing world, it has struggled in the all-important smartphone business. Apple's iPhone and handsets running Google's Android together make up over 95% of sales in the US and China, the world's two largest smartphone markets, . Windows Phone only has shares above 10% in Mexico and France, according to the company's figures. Under the deal, Microsoft is buying the ""Lumia"" and ""Asha"" brand names that Nokia has used for its smart and intermediate phones. It has licensed the use of the Nokia brand on handsets for ten years, but the Finnish business will retain ownership of the brand. That will probably mean that the Nokia brand disappearing from handsets in the next decade, ending over 30 years' history in the business. Having started in 1865 with a pulp mill in the Finnish town of Tampere, Nokia reinvented itself repeatedly, shifting to rubber boot production early in the 20th century, and then making its first telephone exchange in the 1970s. Its first mobile phone appeared in 1981. Rumours that Microsoft intended to buy Nokia had been floated since Elop joined the company. When he chose to dump its home-grown Symbian and Meego smartphone software in favour of Microsoft's newer Windows Phone software in February 2011, a number of Finnish observers accused him of being a ""Trojan horse"" for Microsoft. Ballmer said in a statement: ""It's a bold step into the future – a win-win for employees, shareholders and consumers of both companies. Bringing these great teams together will accelerate Microsoft's share and profits in phones, and strengthen the overall opportunities for both Microsoft and our partners across our entire family of devices and services."" But the deal could also mean that BlackBerry's best chance of being acquired, by Microsoft, is over. The Canadian handset maker, which has seen its revenues and handset sales plummet, has formed a committee seeking alternatives including a sale. But Carolina Milanesi, smartphone analyst at research group Gartner, commented: ""In case there was still hope out there for BlackBerry, this [purchase by Microsoft] is pretty much it. Microsoft will be more aggressive than Nokia in pursuing enterprises."""	Technology
7101	7102	Microsoft unveils Windows 10: 'It wouldn't be right to call it Windows 9' 	Microsoft is to put some numerical distance between its poorly received Windows 8 operating system and its replacement by calling the new version . The new operating system, expected to be released next year, comes three years after the launch of 8. It was announced at an event aimed at business users in Seattle. “Windows 10 will be our most comprehensive platform ever,” Terry Myerson, head of the operating systems group, told the audience. “It wouldn’t be right to call it Windows 9.” The launch is one of several pre-briefings expected over the coming months to sell the new system to different groups, Windows 8 introduced major changes in Microsoft’s operating system, aimed at improving the performance on tablets and other touch-operated devices. The changes came as the software giant continued to struggle in mobile against Google’s Android and Apple. The overhaul failed to impress many users and businesses who felt the new software did not deliver for desktop PC users, and who disliked its unfamiliar tile-based interface. Many declined to upgrade from its predecessor, Windows 7. Before the launch, some had speculated the company might signal a new era at by dropping the Windows name altogether. Internally the project had been called Threshold. In an era dominated by mobile devices and cloud computing, Microsoft has been struggling to adjust. New boss Satya Nadella has been moving away from the aggressive focus on Windows and PCs that was the hallmark of his predecessor, Steve Ballmer. But the choice of Windows 10 acknowledges how the operating system remains at the core of Microsoft’s image and its bottom line. Myerson pointed out that there were about 1.5bn PCs in use on the planet, about the same as the total estimated number of Android devices. But Android’s growth rate far outstrips Windows. “It’s critical,” said Colin Gillis, analyst at BGC Partners in New York. Even with the declining PC business Gillis said about 30% of the company’s revenues came from Windows. But he added that Google’s Android was now the pre-eminent operating system on the planet. “This is the original platform,” said Gillis. “But every other Windows launch hasn’t worked for them. We had Vista, which was a dud, then we had Windows 7, which was great, then we had Windows 8.” Asked if he thought the hit and miss sequence meant the company had made a mistake missing 9, Gillis said: “Hey, let’s hope it’s just some marketing stuff.”	Technology

8343	8344	Ed Miliband prepared to end electoral college for selecting Labour leader 	" is prepared to end the electoral college system for electing the Labour leader as part of reforms to the party's links with the unions. A dispute between Miliband and the unions over their role in the election of a future party leader has emerged as the biggest obstacle to an agreement between the two sides. Paul Kenny, the general secretary of the GMB union, said the talks had broken down, but said they were continuing. Miliband wants to ensure that only union members who have made a decision to become associate members are able to vote in the election of the Labour leader– and he is prepared to end the electoral college in which MPs have a third of the vote, party members a third and union political levy payers a third. Miliband has been looking at the possibility of MPs being responsible for the nomination of candidates to ensure they do not have someone foisted upon them that they oppose. At present anyone that has paid the political levy in a union is allowed to vote in the Labour leadership poll, and a union member has to decide whether to opt out of paying the levy. In future Miliband only wants union members who opt in to the associate membership of the party to have a vote. There have been complaints that too many political levy payers are not Labour supporters and should not have a future role in the leadership election. The unions have suggested that Miliband is unwilling to compromise over the role of MPs, but that is disputed by Labour sources. The party's national executive is due to meet on 4 February to discuss the issue. A special conference will follow on 1 March. Lord Collins, a former Labour party and union official, has been holding discussions with union officials for months. He is due to report to the party's executive at the 4 February meeting. Unions said they believed an outline of a deal had been reached before Christmas, including the abolition of the electoral college. A Labour spokesman said: ""Ed has made clear he wants radical reform. Ray Collins has yet to publish his report and you get this sort of speculation emerging in public when negotiations are taking place in private. ""Ed has always been clear that the scale of his reforms mean that there are likely to be consequences for other rules and structures in the Labour party. He is proposing we change the way we elect our party leaders and discussions on party reform are ongoing."" The GMB has already decided to drastically cut its party funding in protest against the reforms. Other unions might follow suit if there is no agreement. Asked about the likelihood of a deal, Kenny said: ""There were discussions taking place, which have broken down."" He declined to comment further. Labour MP Ian Lavery has described the planned reforms as the biggest political gamble in the history of the party, warning that Labour could lose millions of pounds from union affiliation fees."

4310	4311	Sony’s new Xperia Z1 Compact shows premium Android phones can be small 	 has decided that in the premium smartphone market, smaller can be more beautiful. Rather than competing with the ever-growing screens of rivals such as Samsung or LG, its new Z1 Compact phone has a 4.3in screen – far smaller than the 5in of the Samsung Galaxy S4 or 4.7in HTC One. “With the Z1 Compact we have invented our own market segment: the premium compact smartphone,” Pierre Perron, head of Sony Mobile Europe told the Guardian. Sony thinks that there is a significant market for a more manageable Android phone that fits smaller hands, compared to the 5in and larger screen size trend, while not compromising on specifications. The company reckons the current trend for larger and larger screen sizes, as demonstrated by Samsung's ever expanding Galaxy S and Galaxy Note line, is getting out of hand for consumers. There is some backing from data, collected by US research firm NPD, which suggests that 75% of smartphones in use in the US have screens smaller than 4.5in. Sony has squeezed all of the components from its larger flagship 5in phone, the Xperia Z1, into the Z1 Compact's smaller frame with a 720p high definition screen which, at 340ppi, has a higher pixel density than Apple’s 4in   with its 326ppi “retina display” screen. Sony’s biggest challenge with the Z1 Compact is persuading its target audience – the mainstream consumer – that a smaller phone doesn’t mean a poorer experience, something of which Perron is acutely aware. “We have a strong opportunity to address a new, underserved segment with the Z1 Compact, something Sony did not target in 2013, but we must successfully make the point to the consumer in our marketing that this is not just another cheap, small Android smartphone,” Perron said. It's expected to go on sale for between £400 and £500, though Sony wouldn't confirm a price ahead of the announcement. The Xperia Z1 Compact features a 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 – currently the most powerful ARM-based mobile processor available in smartphones and tablets – a 20.7-megapixel camera, NFC, 4G LTE and a solid, waterproof build that makes it feel every bit a premium Android smartphone, but smaller than the trend. It has a “class leading” 2,300 mAh battery, which Sony says should last a day of heavy usage. It runs Android 4.3 Jelly Bean, but with a promise from Sony to update it to the latest  . Sony argues that its rivals' smaller-screened phones, such as the Samsung S4 Mini or HTC One Mini, are compromised by having slower processors and less RAM than their full-size siblings, meaning they offer poorer performance. The Z1 Compact aims to take sales from  , which up until now has only been challenged by much larger 5in phones that are more difficult to handle, especially one-handed. “To continue our growth year in 2014 to cement and move forward on our number three position in the UK and Europe, we need to compete with the likes of Samsung and Apple,” said Perron. “We are accelerating the pace of technological integration from the other parts of our company, such as our camera and television businesses, into Sony Mobile and the result is the premium experience offered by the Z1 and new Z1 Compact.” To help Sony compete with Apple and allow easier switching from the iPhone to an Android phone, Sony has also launched a range of applications that automate the transfer of data between different phones using Wi-Fi or a USB cable. iPhone app and content bought from iTunes will still not be able to be transferred, of course. “Xperia Z1 is a no-compromise feature-packed smartphone with a beautiful yet durable design. With Xperia Z1 Compact, we bring all of these premium features and performance into a smaller size to give you the ultimate compact smartphone,” said Kunimasa Suzuki, president and chief executive of Sony Mobile Communications. The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact will be available in the UK and other markets in February, in a range of four colours: pink, yellow, black and white.	Technology

Victor Moses's arrival on a season-long loan from Chelsea completed a productive finale for the Anfield club. Sakho had only 12 months remaining on his contract at but with the French champions reluctant to part company with their homegrown talent, Liverpool offered one of the most costly deals for a defender in their history to land the 23-year-old. The France international, concerned his World Cup prospects might suffer amid fierce competition at PSG, can play in central defence or at left-back and was the 2010-11 young player of the year in France. He represents the young, commanding defender that the manager, Brendan Rodgers, has been seeking all summer. also landed the 20-year-old Ilori. The London-born defender has represented Portugal at Under-18, -19 and -20 level and helped take Liverpool's overall summer spend to £44.8m, with £28.7m recouped in sales. Moses completed Rodgers's search for a fresh, wide option, Liverpool having sold Stewart Downing this summer and missed out on Willian. Moses was deemed surplus to requirements for the season at Chelsea but there is no option to buy for Liverpool next summer. Fabio Borini, Rodgers's first signing as Liverpool manager for £10.5m, was due to join Sunderland on loan and Dani Pacheco signed for the Spanish second division side AD Alcorcón for an undisclosed fee.

In recent weeks, as China’s stock market falls , millions of individual investors seemed assured that state intervention to halt the stock market slide had worked. Then, on Monday, the Shanghai stock market suffered its . On Tuesday, the Changle Lu branch of Zheshang Securities was busy with around 30 people hunched over computer terminal screens showing share prices. Many of the terminals were displaying green, which in means losses, with red representing gains. Some of the brokerage customers were frantically punching buttons as if playing on games consoles. This particular stock market game has resulted in serious financial losses for some investors. Most did not want to talk about how much they had lost or whether they still had faith in the government. Questions were batted away with a resigned wave of a hand. One middle-aged man was leaning over a terminal with his hand on his head in what looked like despair. Heated discussions broke out between four people nearby, apparently discussing which types of stocks were performing better. Three unhappy-looking women were sitting on orange plastic chairs taking a break from trading. “Everyone is in a bad mood because they are losing money,” said one of the women who did not want to be named. “Today is not a good day to be asking these questions,” she added angrily. Mr Yuan, standing across the room, was calmly entering data on a computer terminal, deciding what to sell. “I personally have not lost a lot of money,” he said. “I have sold out all the stocks that I held.” Although he thought the government should take further action, he didn’t think this week’s losses showed the government’s intervention had necessarily failed. China’s stock market “is like a psycho – it has been up and down too great a degree,” he said, adding that investors had become greedy and did not have a “stabilised attitude” to the market. Mr Zhou nearby was also standing over a screen, eager to stress he had not lost money, prompting a sceptical laugh from a woman at the neighbouring terminal. He does not blame the government for the ongoing volatility. “The stock market has its own way to function,” he said. “Whether the country [intervenes] or not, it has not much to do with the stock market.” Both Zhou and Yuan said that the Chinese stock markets had changed and that big profits can no longer be made. “We should focus on short-term investment,” said Yuan. Zhou outlined his new strategy: “You buy in when it’s 5 yuan, you sell out when it’s 7 yuan and you gain 2 yuan. That’s it.” 	Business

Daringly, heretically, he advocates transgenic treatments from animals to toughen the skin. In his palatial home, he has a private operating theatre where he carries out experimental work on Vera, a beautiful woman he keeps prisoner, who is dressed only in a clinging gauzy, flesh-toned material and whose skin has an unnaturally smooth, flawless look. She appears to submit ecstatically to her imprisonment, but this is finally to be the cause of madness and violence. The Skin I Live In is adapted from the 2003 novel Mygale (Tarantula) by Thierry Jonquet, but clearly Almodóvar has taken something from Georges Franju's 1960 film Eyes Without a Face and possibly also Alejandro Amenábar's Open Your Eyes from 1997. It is also conceivable that he wants us to think of Evelyn Waugh's story Love Among the Ruins. But influences and allusions are almost beside the point, given the fact that almost every scene, every shot, must remind you of every other Almodóvar picture. As ever, it is sleek and stylishly furnished, sensually charged with richness and colour, and splashes and gashes of red. There is a surging Hitchcockian orchestral score and a breathless sense of imminent violence: handguns are coolly disclosed in desk-drawers and expensive ladies' handbags; crime scenes are established in stunning overhead shots. As in many of his films, family secrets are revealed through lengthy flashbacks – something forbidden to contemporary Hollywood screenwriters. There is the doppelganger motif, and the younger guy who likes partying and drugs; there are staircase scenes and scenes in which a middle-aged man watches the object of his desire, enraptured, on a large screen. And perhaps most startling, and most characteristic of all, there is Almodóvar's great theme of transsexual identity, which speaks of passion, fantasy and escape. The director himself, in various masks and guises, is present in all of this. For those who would like Almodóvar to do something radical – and this was rather how this movie had been misleadingly billed here in Cannes – then The Skin I Live In might try the patience. But I can only say that it kept me gripped from first to last. The sheer muscular confidence of Almodóvar's film-making language gives it force, and co-exists with a dancer's elegance and grace. Without this, the story could look strained and farcical. Instead, its bizarre passions are compelling. Almodóvar brings something hypnotic to the surgery-porn aesthetic of his operating theatre of cruelty: the latex, the scrubs, the cold steel, the exquisite yet appalling contrast between wounds and young flesh. It is twisted and mad, and its choreography and self-possession are superb.	Film
10957	10958	Beethoven (1.4m) beats Bono (20,000) in battle of the internet downloads 	"Forget Coldplay and James Blunt. Forget even Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which, in the version performed at Live8 by Sir Paul McCartney and U2, has become the fastest online-selling song ever. Beethoven has routed the lot of them. Final figures from the BBC show that the complete Beethoven symphonies on its website were downloaded 1.4m times, with individual works downloaded between 89,000 and 220,000 times. The works were each available for a week, in two tranches, in June. Sgt Pepper could well end up as the best-selling online track of all time. But its sales figure of just 20,000 online in the two weeks since it has been available contrasts poorly with the admittedly free Beethoven symphonies. (Sgt Pepper cost 79p on the iTunes website.) To put another perspective on the success of the Beethoven downloads, according to Matthew Cosgrove, director of Warner Classics, it would take a commercial CD recording of the complete Beethoven symphonies ""upwards of five years"" to sell as many downloads as were shifted from the BBC website in two weeks. The BBC has been stunned by the response - so much so that its director general, Mark Thompson, opened his annual report with Beethoven's inscription on the score of the Missa Solemnis: ""From the heart ... May it go again to the heart!"" The classical music industry has also been shocked since the demand for the symphonies seems to defy gloomy predictions about the shrinking appetite for classical music. Roger Wright, the controller of Radio 3, said it was ""clear that people had been coming to Beethoven for the first time"" through the Beethoven downloads. This was discernible from the fact that the symphonies nos 1 and 2 had a high take-up compared with no 3, the Eroica, a much more famous work. But the corporation has yet to unpick more facts about where the downloaders came from and what their musical habits were, though anecdotal evidence suggests that there was an international reach. If nothing else, the figures suggest the extraordinary power of the BBC. Mr Wright said the idea had started as ""just a little extra add-on to draw attention to the fact that the BBC Philharmonic was performing their first complete Beethoven cycle for 30 years"". The symphonies were taken from live performances in the Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, and introduced by a Radio 3 presenter. But it had become clear that the downloads marked ""an important moment, when you see how the world is changing"". He said he had invited industry figures to discuss the implications of the figures. Not everyone was so positive. Some from the recording industry expressed concerns that the BBC was setting itself up as unfair competition in the recording market. Mr Cosgrove said: ""I would be worried if the BBC repeated the experiment. We would take an extremely dim view if it happened repeatedly."" But, he added: ""It's caused quite a bit of controversy - but it has also provided us with an amazing piece of free market research. I don't think anyone had any idea in their wildest dreams that there would be this level of response. Yes, the downloads were free - but if charged at a commercial rate that would have been a huge amount of revenue."" In a speech to the British Phonographic Industry, the trade association for the recording industry, Mr Thompson tried to allay fears from the commercial sector. The anxiety, he said, ""boils down to two questions: is this the start of some new regular service from the BBC, in which, without warning and consultation, the public will be offered chunks of music free at the point of download which will inevitably distort the commercial market in music? And second, are there any limits to what the BBC might download? Could we wake up one morning to discover that half the BBC's musical archive is available on the net? The answer to these two questions is: no and no. I understand where the anxiety is coming from: the music industry is already under assault from piracy of various kinds - and the last thing it needs is the BBC unintentionally opening up some kind of second front."" Radio 3 plans a similar week of broadcasts to its Beethoven Experience later in the year, devoted to Bach. But said Mr Thompson there would be more consultation to "" understand the likely market impact"". Classical recording labels are lagging behind their pop counterparts in embracing the download service providers, according to Mr Cosgrove which have so far been tailored to working with tracks of a maximum of six or eight minutes, ""which wouldn't work for Bruckner"". But, he said, this was changing, and there was a ""vertical learning curve"". According to Chaz Jenkins, the head of LSO Live, the recording company set up by the London Symphony Orchestra, ""downloads are the future for classical music"". He said when the LSO's catalogue first became available on iTunes online sales outstripped those on the high street. ""You can reach audiences who are intimidated by walking into a classical CD store, or who just can't get to one. ""Everyone talks about the early 1980s, when catalogues were re-recorded on CD and everyone replaced their LP collection, as the big boom in the classical recording industry. This could be just as big."" For Mr Jenkins, downloads of the LSO's recordings are not necessarily about building audiences for the orchestra's performances in the concert hall, but about giving the orchestra a reach and a life way beyond it. But Russell Jones, of the Association of British Orchestras, said: ""We'd want to use it to try to drive people to the live performance. The buzz of this happening in the Bridgewater Hall can't be reproduced on a download.""

I heard a little bit late about this possibility, but succeeded in downloading 7, 8 + 9; many thanks and I hope you will continue actions like this one. As a keen internet user, but not normally a classical music listener, I wanted to praise the BBC for making these excellent recordings of Beethoven's symphonies available. I have downloaded the first five and am gently listening through them and really enjoying a new style of music - a welcome change from my normal listening of Radio 1. Thank you BBC! This is a fantastic experiment in the democratisation of high culture, and shows exactly what direction BBC radio should take. If all of BBC radio's range of live concerts/sessions/DJ sets were available in this way, it would lead to the creation of a national ""archive"" in homes across the country. Congratulations to Gianandrea Noseda and the BBC Philharmonic for their excellent performances, and hopefully for being the forerunners to the BBC's emergence as the world's premier digital service."

8731	8732	Communication Workers Union backs Corbyn as antidote to Blairite 'virus' 	Jeremy Corbyn has taken another major step forward in his campaign to become Labour leader after the Communication Workers Union announced that it is to endorse him to act as the antidote to the Blairite “virus” in the party. In a sign that the veteran leftwinger is building up huge momentum in his campaign, the CWU general secretary, that he is to . The transport and travel union, the TSSA, also and that he has backed its calls to take the railways back into public ownership. The TSSA backed Angela Eagle as deputy leader. The decision of the CWU and the TSSA to follow the two largest – Unite and Unison – in supporting Corbyn is fuelling a growing sense in the Labour party that the MP for Islington North is building a momentum that may be unstoppable. On the eve of the close of nominations by constituency Labour parties (CLPs), the that Corbyn is leading the field. It says he has so far secured 133 CLP nominations, followed by 106 for Andy Burnham, 100 for Yvette Cooper and 15 for Liz Kendall. The CLP nominations carry no formal weight, but they can give a strong indication of how the membership will vote. In 2010, David Miliband won the highest number of CLP nominations and won the membership section of the electoral college. His brother, Ed, overtook him after winning strong union support in the trade union and affiliated societies section of the electoral college. Under the new rules, party members, registered supporters and registered trade unions all have one vote. In a statement on Twitter accompanied by , the CWU general secretary, Dave Ward, said his union had decided to back Corbyn because it rejected the idea that Labour should occupy the political centre ground. The CWU advised its members to give their second-preference votes to Andy Burnham and to vote for Angela Eagle and Caroline Flint in first and second places in the deputy leadership contest. Ward said: “I am delighted to announce that the CWU will be backing MP to be the next leader of the Labour party. There are no quick fixes for the Labour party, but there are some easy decisions, and choosing Jeremy as its leader should be one of them. “We think that it is time for a change for Labour. The grip of the Blairites and individuals like must now be loosened once and for all. There is a virus within the Labour party, and Jeremy Corbyn is the antidote. “We reject the notion that Labour needs to move to the centre ground of British politics. The centre ground has moved significantly to the right in recent years. We do not see arguing for fairer wealth distribution, decent jobs with good pay, terms and conditions and a substantial increase in affordable housing for the next generation as a leftwing agenda. “Jeremy agrees with the vast amount of CWU policy, ranging from opposing the selling-off of Royal Mail to offering a real alternative to austerity and repealing anti-trade union laws.” The CWU has 200,000 members, making it Britain’s fifth biggest union behind Unite, Unison, the GMB – which is not backing any candidate – and Usdaw, which is backing Burnham. Tom Watson, the former deputy chair of the Labour party, warned that Corbyn may struggle to enforce discipline in light of his record as a rebel in the House of Commons against successive leaderships. Watson told the Huffington Post: “It would certainly be a difficult thing for him to try and command discipline within parts of the parliamentary Labour party with that voting record, but, you know, members are aware of this. It’s their choice.” Stella Creasy, another candidate for the deputy leadership, criticised what she described as “machine politics” in the Labour movement. This was seen as a swipe at the Labour First group, which is calling on Liz Kendall to ask her supporters to give their second-preference votes to Andy Burnham and to stop Corbyn. Her remarks were also aimed at the Unite union, which is supporting Corbyn. Creasy said: “There’s another side to machine politics, which I also think is turning people off. A way of thinking that has come to do us more harm than good. The sense that the only way to win is through strict uniformity and unquestioning control. A perception then used to justify stitch-ups, petty cliques, back-room deals, and selection fixes. And that feeds the hostility to those in our movement with whom we maybe don’t agree all the time or who are not members at all. It means for too long, factional battles have come before party interest.”	Politics

7889	7890	'Eyewatering' New Labour factor is conspicuous by its absence in manifesto 	"Back in 2005, Tony Blair's aides briefed anyone who would listen that their man's final manifesto was ""unremittingly New , eyewateringly New Labour"". Having been driven into a bunker by the war in Iraq, the party's high command seemed almost to glory in provoking offence, and this was never more true than in connection with the health service, where the removal of ""arbitrary"" limits on privatisation was the story they were most keen to stress. Five years and one banking crisis later, the tone is decidedly different. Behind in the polls, the government knows it can no longer afford to go out of its way to alienate its core vote, and the eyewatering factor is conspicuous by its absence this time. Many of the policies are not vastly different, but the rhetoric is decidedly so. In place of commercial ""contestability"" to break up old NHS structures, the independent sector's role is ""to work alongside the NHS … particularly where it can bring innovation, such as in end-of-life care"". In place of ""every state school an independent state school"", Blair's stated ambition during his last phase at the top, we have a new emphasis on schools coming together in federations, and the softening of the slogans about parent choice with the recognition that the state must ensure that there is good education in every locality. Also missing are some of the more ""unremitting"" policies from Brown's own premiership. There is, for example, no mention at all of Peter Mandelson's scheme to part-privatise Royal Mail. When the proposal was withdrawn last summer, the claim was that this was purely on account of market conditions, rather than because of changing political judgment. Its omission from the manifesto, however, confirms that the politics have indeed changed. Either the unions are reasserting their power over a party which increasingly relies on their funding, or else the party leadership as a whole has taken the view that the public is not in a mood for more privatisation just now. Today's proposals to turn the Post Office into a People's Bank suggested that trusted public services can fill gaps left by markets, a popular post-credit crunch message, but one that would have been badly clouded by an insistence on selling Royal Mail to the highest bidder. Student finance is one final area where there was a gaping hole in place of a policy. Amid all the warm words about universities, the chief promise was merely to await the outcome of the Browne review into tuition loans and fees. This omission, however, is attributable to electoral calculation rather than shifting ideology. The review is virtually certain to propose higher fees in response to the great squeeze on universities, but Labour would rather keep schtum until polling day is out of the way. And when it comes to putting eye-watering messages before student voters, I would expect the Conservatives to be just as coy when they publish their own manifesto tomorrow."	Politics
14972	14973	Tottenham agree £4.3m deal to sign Kevin Wimmer from FC Köln 	 have agreed a €6m (£4.3m) deal with FC Köln to sign the central defender Kevin Wimmer in the summer. The 22-year-old has enjoyed a breakthrough season at the German club, starting in 24 of their 25 Bundesliga matches, and he has impressed Tottenham with his composure, physicality and aerial ability. Wimmer, who is 6ft 2in tall, moved to FC Köln from Linz in his native Austria for €250,000 in 2012. He fits the profile of the type of player that Tottenham want to add, as he is young, talented and hungry to progress. The club are determined to build for the longer term and over the duration of the manager Mauricio Pochettino’s five-year contract. In January, he oversaw the signings of DeAndre Yedlin, the 21-year-old right-back from the Seattle Sounders, and . Alli has been loaned back to the Dons for the remainder of the season. Pochettino has placed his faith in many young players since his arrival from Southampton last summer, including Ryan Mason, Nabil Bentaleb and Harry Kane. Wimmer’s arrival will place further question marks against the White Hart Lane futures of the centre-backs Younès Kaboul and Vlad Chiriches. Kaboul was surprisingly given the club captaincy in the early weeks of the season but he has since fallen from favour.	Football
11572	11573	Manchester United 0-1 Chelsea 	"There's only one team in Europe, the Chelsea fans reminded their counterparts throughout this game, proving that even the much-maligned Europa League has its uses. It is still Champions League qualification that matters most, especially with a new manager to recruit, and three points from one of Old Trafford's tamer afternoons courtesy of their deflected but deserved winner returned Chelsea to third place before Wednesday's showdown against Spurs at Stamford Bridge. Rafael Benítez will be keen to have Eden Hazard back for that game. The Belgian failed a late fitness test on a calf strain and his creativity was missed. Even without him managed to be more creative than United, who failed to score at home for the first time in 67 league matches. They also had a player sent off for the first time this season, though until Oscar picked out Juan Mata with a splendid pass four minutes from time it appeared neither side would be imaginative or committed enough to deserve all three points. Just about the only time Mata put a foot wrong was in claiming afterwards that the occasion had been ""like a final"". It was hardly that. Petr Cech was on firmer ground when he said it had been a strange, end-of-season game. ""The pace was quite a bit slower than usual but we did really well to come here and win,"" the goalkeeper said. While Mata's shot may end up being credited as an own goal by Phil Jones, it would never have happened without the Spaniard's ability to find space and his team-mates' willingness to keep going to the very end of a long season. ""We cannot give up now,"" Mata said. ""Our aim is to finish third and we can do that if we keep winning. That's what we must do because I think we deserve to be in the Champions League next season."" Chelsea showed marginally the more enterprise in a tepid first half, with Mata picking out Demba Ba with crosses on a couple of occasions, Victor Moses shooting too high with a decent chance and Oscar almost catching the home defence out with a run and a low shot that Anders Lindegaard could only touch on to a post. United waited until the stroke of half-time to get Robin van Persie on to the end of anything, though once they managed to find him he was unlucky not to put his side in front. An instinctive first touch to a terrific through ball from Ryan Giggs surprised Cech but curled just the wrong side of a post. He then headed straight at the goalkeeper from a Nemanja Vidic cross. United's other main chance to take an interval lead came when Cech parried a cross straight to Tom Cleverley on the edge of the area, yet with a better opportunity than he possibly realised the fringe player lacked the composure to take advantage, shooting early and blazing over the bar. Chelsea might have had a penalty at the start of the second half when Giggs hauled down David Luiz as he entered the area. Howard Webb waved away their claims, which seemed reasonable as the offence seemed to originate outside the box, though it appeared overly generous of the referee not even to award a free-kick. Despite the introductions of Wayne Rooney and Fernando Torres, the game was petering out feebly in the second half, with United happy enough to settle for a second successive draw. Chelsea's lack of urgency was harder to understand, though it turned out they were merely biding their time. The buildup to the goal began on the edge of their own penalty area, with Ramires cleanly dispossessing Rooney; then, as the ball was worked upfield through Ramires and Frank Lampard, United made the mistake of leaving Mata unmarked in the box. Oscar spotted him and supplied him, and a low shot that took a deflection off Jones beat Lindegaard's dive to creep in off the far post. ""It was a bit of a lucky goal, going in off Phil Jones,"" said Sir Alex Ferguson at his curmudgeonly best, though at least the United manager did not dispute Ramires's tackle on Rooney, or indeed the result. ""We took our foot off the pedal so we can't complain,"" Ferguson said. ""We didn't play well enough to deserve anything."" Any hope United had of answering back disappeared with the hot-tempered Rafael Da Silva when the full-back was dismissed for kicking out at David Luiz. The Chelsea defender, not entirely innocent in the coming together that provoked Da Silva's petulance, was seen smirking to himself as he lay clutching his knees by the corner flag after checking to see that the referee had produced a red card. Ferguson was not best pleased. ""He was elbowed but I don't think the referee saw that,"" he said. ""All he saw was Luiz rolling around on the floor like a diving swan."" Yet for once Ferguson was not the centre of the story, and even more unusually his team were not the one with the most desire. This was another stealthy but significant victory for Benítez. Something else that will stand out on what even Ferguson must now admit is quite an impressive CV, even if is he in the habit of mentioning it too often. Juan Mata (Chelsea)"	Football
4211	4212	Farewell, Mr Mario – former Nintendo head Hiroshi Yamauchi dies 	"He was known as ""the godfather of the console"", building the Japanese firm from a playing cards manufacturer into one of the world's most powerful computer games businesses. Now the gaming industry is paying tribute to the company's former president, Hiroshi Yamauchi, who diedon Thursday at 85. For a generation of gamers, Yamauchi's Nintendo represented a golden era of mainstream gaming, dominated by classic titles like Super Mario Bros, Legend of Zelda and Metroid. In the early 90s, the company's mascot Mario, a moustachioed Italian plumber, became one of the world's most popular animated characters. A 1990 survey found he was more recognisable to American children than Mickey Mouse. Yamauchi installed the company's central doctrine – that gameplay is always more important than technology. It is the philosophy that would continue to define the company after his retirement, leading to the hugely successful Nintendo Wii, which introduced a motion control device for gaming but relied on cheap off-the-shelf hardware, unlike its expensive rivals, the PS3 and Xbox 360. The company said it was ""in mourning today from the sad loss of the former Nintendo president Mr Hiroshi Yamauchi, who sadly passed away this morning."" Yamauchi took over the company after his grandfather, the previous president, suffered a stroke. He transformed Nintendo from a little-known manufacturer of Japanese playing cards into the most powerful force in the global video game industry, and stood as president of the company from 1949 to 2002. Yamauchi had a reputation for spotting talent and at a Nintendo factory he picked out engineer Gunpei Yokoi, who would eventually go on to develop the Game Boy handheld console. Yokoi had built a robotic arm for his own amusement, but Yamauchi saw the potential to mass-market the device as a product, kickstarting Nintendo's expansion into the toy and gadget market. Noting the boom in video games, Yamauchi later asked young artist Shigeru Miyamoto to create an arcade machine that would appeal to the growing global audience. The result was Donkey Kong, a massive success in its own right and the origin of the Mario character. The long-standing president would go on to oversee the company's entry into the home console business, which it dominated in the 80s and early 90s with the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) consoles. At its height, Nintendo enjoyed a 90% share of the console hardware market. Importantly, in the wake of the video game crash in 1983, where a glut of mediocre third-party releases for consoles such as the Atari VCS effectively devalued the whole industry, Yamauchi oversaw the introduction of Nintendo's ""seal of quality"" programme, which restricted the numbers of developers that could release games on its systems. He intrinsically understood the importance of good games and talented game designers, rather than engineers and hi-tech hardware. In 2004, he told one Japanese newspaper: ""Cutting-edge technologies and multiple functions do not necessarily lead to more fun. The excessively hardware-oriented way of thinking is totally wrong, but manufacturers are just throwing money at developing higher-performance hardware."" A shrewd businessman, Yamauchi ensured that Nintendo remained debt-free throughout his long period in charge. Unlike the consoles marketed by most of his competitors, Nintendo machines were always sold at a profit rather than as loss-leaders for software sales; he also ensured that game publishers paid in advance for the manufacturing of game carts, removing the risk for his own company. In this way, he helped to revolutionise the way the games industry functioned. Although Yamauchi stepped down in 2002 to be replaced by current president Satoru Iwata, he remained a major shareholder and retained an advisory role. ""Hiroshi Yamauchi transformed a run-of the-mill trading card company into an entertainment empire in video games,"" said Ian Livingstone, co-founder of Workshop and life president of games developer Eidos. ""He understood the social value of play, and the economic potential of electronic gaming. Most importantly, he steered Nintendo on its own course and was unconcerned by the actions of his competitors. He was a true visionary."""	Technology
15130	15131	David Cameron in France to sign nuclear power deal 	"Britain and are to sign a landmark agreement to co-operate on civil nuclear energy, paving the way for the construction of a new generation of power plants in the UK. Deals between British and French companies – worth more than £500m – will allow work to start on new facilities, creating more than 1,500 jobs. The prime minister, , who is in Paris to meet the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, to seal the deal, said the agreements were ""just the beginning"" of investment the government says could be worth £60bn and create 30,000 jobs. A joint declaration to be signed by the two leaders at a UK-France summit will signal a shared commitment to civil nuclear power, establishing a framework for co-operation on security, research and development, education and training. The unrest in Syria, defence and concerns over Iran's possible ambitions for nuclear weapons will also be high on the agenda. Sarkozy announced this week that he will stand for re-election in presidential elections to be held on 22 April and 6 May, with polls suggesting he is trailing his Socialist rival, François Hollande. Downing Street said that by joining forces in the nuclear sector, Britain and France sould develop a competitive supply chain capable of seizing opportunities around the world. Rolls-Royce will sign a £400m deal with the French energy company Areva to supply services to the first EPR reactor at Hinkley Point in Somerset, with a commitment for future EPR sites in the UK. Rolls-Royce will build a dedicated factory in Rotherham, and the deal will underpin more than 1,200 jobs in the company and its supply chain. The French company EDF will conclude a £100m agreement with Keir/BAM Nuttall for preliminary works at Hinkley Point – the first major construction project to be awarded in the £10bn project. EDF will invest in a £15m training campus in nearby Bridgwater. Speaking ahead of the meeting, Cameron said: ""At our last summit, we signed a historic partnership on defence. Today we will match that ambition on nuclear energy. ""The deals signed today will create more than 1,500 jobs in the UK, but they are just the beginning. ""I want the vast majority of the content of our new nuclear plants to be constructed, manufactured and engineered by British companies. And we will choose the partners and technologies to maximise the economic benefits to the UK. Today marks an important first step towards that – a good deal for Britain and a good deal for France."" The energy secretary, Ed Davey, travelling to Paris with Cameron a fortnight after his promotion to the cabinet, said: ""We need hundreds of billions of pounds of investment in clean energy projects in the UK. This will bring high-skilled job opportunities the length and breadth of the country. ""There are plans for new nuclear in Somerset, Suffolk, Cumbria, North Wales and Gloucestershire. Supply chains will spring up too, and extend the reach of economic benefit across the country."" The summit comes on the first anniversary of the uprising against Muammar Gaddafi in Libya, which saw the UK and France work closely together in the UN-backed military operation to protect civilians. Cameron said: ""One year on from the Libya uprising, we are working together to stand up to the murderous Syrian regime and to stop a nuclear weapon in the hands of Iran."""	Politics
8067	8068	North Sea oil and gas needs reform to boost revenue, oil billionaire says 	"Urgent action to shake up regulation of the North Sea oil and gas industry could generate an extra £200bn for the British economy, according to a billionaire industry grandee. Sir Ian Wood, the former chairman of energy services company , has called for a powerful new regulator to co-ordinate action by North Sea operators in the UK's economic interest. He said operators currently act independently and often in conflict with each other, instead of co-operating to boost production. Wood said they should be required to pledge their commitment to maximising economic potential. Full and quick adoption of his proposals would produce at least an extra three or four billion barrels of oil equivalent over 20 years, Wood said, creating more than £200bn of value for Britain's economy. He said the government could have a shadow regulator up and running within six months to work with staff at the Department of Energy and Climate Change. ""I don't know what the cost is but compared with the rewards it is absolutely minuscule,"" he said. ""The size of the prize is absolutely enormous."" A 38% fall in production over the past three years has cost the Treasury £6bn in lost taxes and declining exploration threatens more missed opportunities, Wood said. He said an arm's-length regulator was needed to co-ordinate improvements in the North Sea's ageing infrastructure and to get more than 300 fields working to full capacity. ""The government have taken this more seriously over the last couple of years. I hope they will realise there is that urgency."" Wood's interim report was commissioned by the energy secretary, , in June. The final report is due early next year. Davey said: ""This report has given government and industry alike plenty to think about, and I'm looking forward to receiving Sir Ian's report and setting out our plans to make the most of our offshore oil and gas fields in the new year."""

3408	3409	Happier meal? McDonald's trials table service in UK as part of major revamp 	McDonald’s is responding to increased competition in the fast food market by entering the slow lane. The home of the Big Mac and the rapid-fire eating experience is offering table service in the UK for the first time. The company is trialling the new approach at a branch in Mottram, , and plans to roll it out to 11 more locations by the end of the month, before taking the system nationwide. For those who prefer to queue, there will still be the option of ordering at the till. The embrace of table service is the latest attempt to modernise the image of restaurants in the face of competition from gourmet burger brands such as Five Guys and Shake Shack, Mexican chains such as Chipotle, and established rivals Burger King and KFC. Customers will be able to order from digital kiosks or staff with tablet computers, with the food then delivered to their table. The initiative is targeted at young families and customers who do not want to wait at the traditional McDonald’s counter. McDonald’s first opened in Britain in 1974 and now has more than 1,250 restaurants in the UK. It has trialled table service in restaurants in France, Germany, Switzerland and Australia. However, the ambitious UK launch represents a notable step up for the strategy as the chief executive, , a Briton, tries to breathe new life into a brand that is struggling in the US in particular. While McDonald’s has enjoyed 37 consecutive quarters of growth in the UK, it is . The poor US performance led to a 14% fall in group profits in 2014, one of the worst performances in McDonald’s history. Easterbrook, who was appointed to the top job in January after a long career at the chain, punctuated by spells at Wagamama and Pizza Express, is under pressure to revive one of the world’s most famous brands. He has and return excitement to the golden arches, while admitting that the world’s largest burger chain was “not on our game” and had allowed its menu to become too complicated. So far this year, McDonald’s has pressed ahead with a string of measures designed to overhaul struggling restaurants across the world. These include the launch of an all-day breakfast menu, allowing customers to build their own burgers, a customer complaint app in Japan and a pledge to stop selling chicken raised with antibiotics. The new managing director of McDonald’s UK, Paul Pomroy, is overseeing a refurbishment programme of the company’s restaurants estimated to be costing more than £350m. This includes providing Apple iPads and Samsung Galaxy tablets that children can play with, installing digital kiosks where customers can make orders and building glass shopfronts on McDonald’s restaurants. About 250 McDonald’s restaurants will have been revamped by the end of the year. Pomroy said McDonald’s was making changes to restaurants and introducing table service in response to customer feedback. He said the company would not increase prices to pay for the overhaul. “We have listened to customer feedback and to meet their evolving expectations, we are significantly investing in our restaurants to create an exciting new environment and improve the customer experience,” Pomroy, who , said. “We also plan to test some new ideas. For example, we know that for parents it can be tough juggling the kids and carrying your food, so we have decided to trial table service, whereby customers place their order via our new kiosks and then have their food brought to them. “It is currently on test in one restaurant here in the UK, but with plans to increase the trial to about a dozen restaurants over the coming month. It’s an idea that has been successfully launched in France, and we are keen to see if it will prove as popular with our customers in the UK.” Neil Saunders, a retail and consumer analyst at Conlumino in the US, said McDonald’s faced a battle with the thousand of franchisees who run the chain’s 36,000 restaurants around the world to modernise its sites and menu. He said: “The store experience is generally poor and is not inspiring or inviting for customers. The firm has loads of old outlets across the US which are in need of upgrading. Generally, the store estate is in a much worse condition to the UK. To be fair, McDonald’s has made a start and is making stores more contemporary and nicer to dwell in, but there is a lot of work still to be done.” Referring to the so-called fast casual phenomenon that has seen McDonald’s lose customers among younger people in particular, he added: “The menu choices need updating. While younger consumers do not dislike McDonald’s per se, they do have more sophisticated tastes and more options to exercise those tastes – like Chipotle. “McDonald’s is challenged as it needs to both stick to its core menu and provide some variety and more exciting options.” Warning of a potential struggle with franchisees, he said: “At present, franchisees are under a lot of pressure financially and many are disgruntled about menu complexity and other changes McDonald’s has been making. McDonald’s has not done a great job in communicating its future strategy and probably needs to give more financial support to franchisees if it wants to up the pace of change.”	Business
13415	13416	Republic of Ireland 2-2 Austria 	"The sense of deflation was palpable. The Republic of Ireland's players sank to their haunches as the Austrian supporters massed behind the goal pierced the sub-zero evening with their celebrations. Giovanni Trapattoni's men had almost been able to touch three precious World Cup qualifying points. They had almost closed the door on . But hard luck stories have limited appeal and David Alaba's last-gasp blast, with a mere 90 seconds of injury-time to play, packed a brutal punch. Ireland's mission to build on the encouraging 0-0 draw in Sweden from Friday fell flat. This was a tie against lower-ranked opposition that they needed to win. Positive results against such teams have been the lifeblood of Trapattoni's reign. The post-match focus was downbeat, despite Ireland remaining in contention for a play-off berth in Group C. They had closed ranks in the second-half, with Trapattoni's determination to preserve what he had being signalled by the 83rd minute substitution of the striker Shane Long for the defensive midfielder Paul Green. Trapattoni felt his team had become stretched in the centre of the field. There had been character from those in green against technically superior opponents, not least in the recovery from the soft early concession of a goal to Martin Harnik, which was precipitated by a lapse from Ciaran Clark. Jon Walters' first-half goals had given Ireland the platform to fashion positive headlines. But having largely restricted Austria in terms of second-half chances, their inability to keep possession at the very last had sickening consequences. Harnik worked the ball to Alaba, the Bayern Munich full-back who plays in midfield for his country, and his fizzing shot flicked off the substitute Sean St Ledger to beat David Forde. Trapattoni's regrets took in Long's marvellously crafted back-heel on 38 minutes that hit a post; a pair of second-half flicks on set-pieces that might have made the scoreline 3-1, and the Alaba deflection. But he lingered most painfully on Ireland's sloppiness in injury-time. ""It's not fair play to waste time but in Italy, Spain, you go to the corners,"" Trapattoni said. ""We had a free-kick and two young players play two-touch. We lose the ball and we concede. We could have finished the game. We missed a bit of experience."" The boos at the full-time whistle betrayed the frustration, and Trapattoni heard his future called into question although, as ever, he was not for turning. ""Why? We have the same table, the situation has not changed,"" he said. ""We have been a little bit unlucky but not too much. Austria reacted well in the second-half. I am not satisfied with the draw but it was right."""	Football
189	190	Louis van Gaal claims he will need a ‘bar stool’ to watch Holland play 	 has revealed that he is unhappy with the view from the dugout at the Estadio Beira-Rio and joked that he will need a “bar stool” to be able to watch Holland’s group game against Australia. The Holland manager was seen remonstrating with a Fifa official during the training session at the stadium in Porto Alegre, on the eve of their second group match, and later said that he expects the issue to be resolved. Quite what Fifa can do is unclear – the dugout sits below ground level – but van Gaal made it clear that he was far from impressed, so much so that he was pleased the issue was brought up in his pre-match press conference. “I’m glad you asked this question, which means it will be disclosed,” said Van Gaal when asked why he appeared unhappy with one of the officials. “The key issue is football and the manager is part of football and I have no view. Because in the middle of the pitch [on the touchline] there is a cameraman who deprives me of the view, and with me all the coaches and managers sitting on the ground, because we are dug under rather than dug out. That obliges us to stand up. I’m a sitting-down coach, not a standing-up coach. The person in charge of this should ask, so I’ve done my very best, as he will.” Asked whether he was confident that Fifa would put things right before the match against , Van Gaal replied: “I am a man of trust.” After the press conference had finished, Van Gaal clarified why he was so frustrated. “The dug-out is at a lower level than the pitch and from where I sit there is also a camera directly in front, so I will be like this [motions from side to side] to try to watch the game. I will need a bar stool to watch the game properly.” Van Gaal refused to disclose whether he would retain the 5-3-2 formation that worked so brilliantly against Spain, when won 5-1, but he was quick to fire a few bullets at those that had questioned his tactics. “There will always be criticism,” he said. “If I use 4-3-3 there would be criticism as well. Some things positive and negative. And when I’m involved, it’s generally negative.”	Football
14295	14296	UK unemployment rate falls to 7.7% 	"Britain's unemployment rate has fallen to 7.7%, in the first tentative step towards the 7% target governor Mark Carney says may signal an economy strong enough to withstand a rise in interest rates. The jobless rate has become a closely watched indicator in the City since the Bank's monetary policy committee introduced its policy of forward guidance, promising to leave borrowing costs on hold at their record low of 0.5% at least until unemployment falls to 7%. on the broad International Labour Organisation measure tracked by the Bank stood at 2.49 million from May to July, down by 24,000 from three months earlier, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). That took the unemployment rate to 7.7%, from 7.8% over the previous three-month period, driven by a larger-than-expected 80,000 increase in employment. On the more timely claimant count measure, which just includes people receiving out-of-work benefits, unemployment also fell, by 32,600 in August to 1.4m. Sterling surged to a seven-month high against both the euro and the dollar after the news, as investors continued to bet on a stronger recovery than the MPC expects. ""Markets are clearly ignoring Carney's 'low rates for longer' pledge and driving sterling higher in currency markets,"" said Nawaz Ali, market analyst at Western Union. Carney used his first set-piece speech as governor to set out the reasons why he doesn't expect unemployment to fall sharply over the next two years; and stress that the 7% threshold was a ""staging post"", which need not trigger an automatic rate rise. Chris Williamson, chief economist at data provider Markit, said: ""The upturn in the labour market bodes well for the sustainability of the wider recovery, as more people in employment and rising wages should help boost economic growth further. The improvement also increases the possibility that unemployment could fall faster than the Bank of England expects, meaning an earlier hike in interest rates than 2016, as currently envisaged under the Bank's 'forward guidance'."" There were 334,000 new jobs created in the economy between June and a year earlier, the ONS said – the latest period for which figures are available – with the largest increase, of 117,000, coming in health and social work, within the private sector. With the housing market starting to show signs of life, there was a 77,000 rise in the number of people employed in ""real estate activities"". Despite the improving picture, there was also evidence in the detail of the figures that conditions in the labour market remain tough for many. Average pay rose at an annual rate of just 1%, or 1.1% including bonuses – well below the 2.8% rate of inflation – suggesting that living standards are still being squeezed. The ONS also highlighted the fact that much of the increase in employment – almost all of it, for women – has been in part-time work, in many cases taken up by employees who would prefer a full-time job if they could find one. Almost a third of men, and 13.5% of women, in part-time work or self-employment would prefer to be in a full-time role, according to the ONS. Long-term unemployment has also remained stubbornly high: while overall unemployment has fallen by 105,000 over the past 12 months, the number of people unemployed for more than a year is little changed, at just below 900,000. Young people are also failing to feel the benefit of the upturn, with youth unemployment 9,000 higher in May to July than three months earlier, at 960,000."	Business
10273	10274	England hit by Jordan Henderson injury blow for Switzerland qualifier 	England have suffered another injury scare before Monday’s awkward opening Euro 2016 qualifying game against when Jordan Henderson limped out of the team’s training session at St Jakob Park on the eve of arguably their toughest fixture in the section. Henderson departed nursing a problem with his right ankle after turning away from a tackle but, having been assessed on the pitch by the team’s medical staff, he did at least hobble off unaided. The player had been earmarked to anchor the midfield against the side ranked ninth in the world and will be monitored on Monday morning prior to undergoing a fitness test before the Group E game, though his participation in the match appears in considerable doubt. James Milner, who has mustered 63 minutes in three substitute appearances for club and country this season and was offered only 76 in a dead rubber against Costa Rica at the summer’s World Cup, played alongside Jack Wilshere in the practice game that continued after Henderson’s exit. The Manchester City player appears the likeliest candidate to occupy the central role if required, in favour of the inexperienced Fabian Delph, though the late change in thinking still constitutes a blow to Roy Hodgson’s preparations. The manager is already without Henderson’s club-mate Daniel Sturridge, after the striker damaged a thigh in training at St George’s Park on Friday, with Danny Welbeck to return to the starting line-up. Although Hodgson is relishing being back in the country he took to the World Cup 20 years ago, he admitted he had sensed “a slight swing” against his tenure back home since the traumas in Brazil, though his priority is far from courting popularity from a sceptical public. Indeed, he was offered a resounding endorsement by his captain, Wayne Rooney, speaking on behalf of the 19-man squad in Switzerland. There has been grumbling discontent since the summer, with the mood hardly improved by last week’s uninspiring friendly win over Norway. “Am I seeing the nasty side of the job? No,” said Hodgson, who experimented with 4-2-3-1 and a midfield diamond in training. “There is no nasty side. I love this job. It’s a magnificent job. To have the chance to coach your country is the pinnacle of any coaching career. I am aware that, after the enormous disappointment of the World Cup, there may have been a slight swing in popularity. I’d have been surprised had there not been. But the real support and popularity [that counts] is with the group of players I work with. “I want to be respected by the players for the job I can do as a professional. That’s all that bothers me. I need them to believe that we can move forward and achieve things and I get good vibrations and feelings from them. I’m sure we will never, really, be able to explain to people how badly we felt on the plane home from Brazil. It’s all very well being asked how you feel – you try to put words to it – but the feelings we had in the dressing room after the Uruguay game in São Paulo will live with us for a long time. It’s up to us now to perform. “Is it enough for us to come here, put 10 men behind the ball and sneak a 0-0? No, I’d say it isn’t. We have to play well and, if it costs us the result, we have to make sure we learn from losing the battle and make sure we win the war. Winning this game does not make us a great team in 2016. Neither does losing it make us a poor team in 2016. We are carrying on the process we started two years ago, despite the massive blow of the World Cup, and we have to make sure after these next two years we are very, very strong.” Rooney’s support was offered up in praise of the work Hodgson is undertaking with a young, inexperienced side. “Us as a team, not just myself, we back Roy 100%,” the captain said. “We made that clear after we went out of the World Cup. He brings ideas to us. We know the tournament in the summer was a disappointment but I still feel we can move forward as a team. We’re progressing all the time and that will show in the next two years. The lads are working hard to get the best out of the ideas Roy is showing us. Hopefully we can do that in the next two years.”	Football
249	250	Gareth Bale inspires Real Madrid’s extra-time barrage to crush Atlético 	At the final whistle, the first person to embrace Gareth Bale was Cristiano Ronaldo. They danced, they waved their shirts and they tried to catch their breath. Real Madrid’s long, obsessive wait for was over. And yet, in that wild, eccentric finale there was something happening at the other end of the pitch, too. Atlético’s supporters had broken into spontaneous applause for their team as soon as Bale put Carlo Ancelotti’s side ahead, and the ovation did not stop even when the game ran away from them and the score started to feel like a deception. Diego Simeone’s team had given everything and it is just a pity that he lost the plot after Ronaldo put in the penalty that completed the scoring. Atlético’s players had chased and harried and, until that dramatic late flurry of goals, they had refused to allow Ronaldo to show himself to be the single most important occupant of this football pitch. At one point, the trophy was adorned in red and white ribbons and Atlético were on the verge of completing one of the great football stories. The clock was showing 93 minutes when Sergio Ramos’s header took the game into extra time. Football can be a brutal business sometimes. For Bale, the night ended with him planting a kiss on the side of the trophy. He could be forgiven for thinking it never gets better than this and perhaps he is right. His header arrived five minutes into the second half of extra time and, briefly, it had looked being the winning goal. The irony is that, for a long time, it had looked like he would remember his first final as an ordeal, passing up three good opportunities before Ramos saved his team. Of all the lingering images, there was Iker Casillas kissing Ramos’s forehead just before the first period of extra time. Casillas had been at fault for Diego Godín’s 36th-minute goal and must have feared it would be the crucial moment. “It was a lovely thing we had in our grasp,” Simeone said, ruefully. What followed was extraordinarily harsh on his team, but it is also true that they had started to look weary and were not creating any real threat by the point everything began to unravel. Bale’s goal came from one of the surging left-wing runs from Ángel di María that made him the game’s outstanding performer. Three players were beaten with one change of pace and shift in movement. Thibaut Courtois was in the way of the Argentinian’s shot and Bale was following in at the far post to score the most important goal of his career. Marcelo made it 3-1 with a left-foot drive that went under Courtois’ body and among the celebrations for Ronaldo’s penalty, after he had gone down under Godín’s challenge, Simeone was so incensed when Raphaël Varane kicked the ball towards the opposition dugout he charged on the pitch to confront the defender. Despite his red card it was difficult not to sympathise with Atlético. Simeone was applauded in and out of his press conference and promised his side would carry on “annoying” their wealthier, more illustrious rivals next season. Atlético had lost Diego Costa to a recurrence of his hamstring troubles after only nine minutes – “It was my responsibility and my mistake,” Simeone said – but they swiftly set about displaying the qualities that had taken them to the Spanish title: quick to the ball, playing with structure and organisation, and absolutely determined to restrict the blur of movement, speed and high skill that is Ronaldo. “Nuestra Forma De Vida,” read the huge banner that was unveiled among the Atlético supporters before kick-off. It translates as “our way of life” and Atlético, with great conviction, chased everything. There was only one occasion in the opening 45 minutes when the most parsimonious defence in Spanish football looked vulnerable and that was the chance that fell to Bale, after Tiago’s sloppy pass, in the 32nd minute. Running through the middle, the opportunity was there to score a goal of raw power and acceleration but Miranda did just enough to put him off and the shot was misplaced. Within four minutes Atlético had a corner. Varane headed the ball away but Juanfran turned it back into the penalty area and Casillas really should not have left his goal-line. Godín beat Sami Khedira to the ball and sent a looping header over the goalkeeper. Bale would have two more chances in the second half and drilled them both wide. He could conceivably have finished the night reflecting on those misses. The most devastating part for Atlético is that, for a long time, they seemed tactically prepared for everything their opponents could muster. They cut out space, their full-backs did not stray forward and the mistake from Tiago felt like an affront to their entire strategy. “We suffered a lot,” Ancelotti said afterwards. “We didn’t have any space. But we did try right to the last. You can say I am a lucky man but we did keep on going right to the last second.” Luka Modric swung over the decisive corner for Ramos to head in the equaliser and, as Ancelotti said, after that “everything changed”. Di María’s performance embodied that perseverance. One of his first-half runs ended with him being chopped down by Raúl García. Another in the second half was ended by an even more cynical challenge, this time from Miranda. Di María, however, could not be discouraged and it was a brilliant run to help Bale make it 2-1. The next two goals felt incongruous to the real story of the game but Madrid, ultimately, deserved to get hold of the trophy they cherish above everything else.	Football
14612	14613	Labour candidates attack 'predictable and out of touch' election campaign 	A devastatingly frank attack on “Labour’s narrow, predictable and out of touch” 2015 election campaign is to be launched on Tuesday by seven of the party’s candidates who failed to win critical swing seats in England in May. In a joint open letter to the party, they say: “From thousands of doorstep conversations we all heard repeatedly our former leadership was not taken seriously while our purpose and policies failed to resonate with voters.” The campaign, the authors claim, addressed only “the needy and greedy”, leaving the rest ignored. The party had nothing to say on welfare, business creation or immigration, “sounding as if it was on the side of those that don’t work”. Labour, they say, was “frightened to enter the difficult conversations on immigration, leaving those discussions to go on without the party”. The seven also suggest Labour needs not just to regain economic credibility but to rethink its approach to immigration, advocating a shift from free to fair movement of labour within the EU. They write: “We need to answer concerns about immigration and identity, especially for people attracted by Ukip’s resistance to change. We need to show how we improve the welfare system. We cannot simply defend a status quo that many people think is unfair. We won’t win over hard-working people if we demonise the private sector in which so many people work. We need the humility to listen to the people of the country, as well as our party, to talk about contribution and responsibility as well as equality and fairness.” The stark account of their doorstep conversations may shock a leadership election campaign accused of rather than reflecting on how the electorate thinks. Summing up the report – Never Again, prepared for the Fabian Society – Lord Adonis, the former cabinet minister, says the candidates “tell a fairly similar story of an energetic ground campaign but an inadequate national campaign. The verdicts are of a defeat in the broad realm of ideas and positioning, not individual policies”. The seven are not from one wing of the party, but include some of the most highly regarded Labour candidates in target seats that Labour has to win to form a government. They are (candidate for Thurrock), (Rossendale and Darwen), Sally Keeble (Northampton North), (Southampton Itchen), Luke Pollard (Plymouth Sutton and Devonport), James Frith (Bury North) and Jessica Asato (Norwich North). In her chapter, Davis warns that “the party has gone off track and lost touch with the country”. She writes: “No matter what the polls said, you could smell it. You could feel it at that door on election day, you felt it when you dismissed a Ukip voter’s concerns about levels of European immigration with promises to hire more border guards, or when you tried to deny someone’s concerns about our economic record. The leadership seemed to assume that people were either needy, greedy or irrelevant. Citizens needed to be looked after, disciplined or ignored. Above all, they were not to be trusted. There was no space for community, contribution or country. “We mimicked the worst parts of capitalism by reducing citizens to consumers who were assumed to vote on individual calculations about profit maximisation such as . But we also pursued the worst of the top-down, highly centralised state. “We were left with a cold, utilitarian narrative that was ultimately based on adversity between the classes and a distrust of the English people. We had been told by senior figures in the party that Ukip was a boon to Labour, splitting the right of the country, but not for marginal seats like ours. In these white working class communities, particularly on the coast, . “This loss of the white working class vote is a crisis for our party, not just because we lost, but because it raises an existential question about who we represent.” Straw asserts welfare should have been at the centre of the party’s campaign, including the system’s failings. “Wherever I turned there was a palpable sense that the welfare system was devoid of any sense of contribution,” he writes. “Despite Labour’s vocal campaigning, people rarely wanted to talk about the unless they were directly affected. Instead, they wanted to know what Labour would do about the family down the street on benefits who’d ‘never done an honest day’s work in their life’ or why some families jumped up the housing ladder. It might make us feel uncomfortable and it might be unfair, but the public thought that we were on the side of people who don’t work.” He adds: “Ed Miliband the deficit in his 2014 conference speech. He didn’t even plan to talk about the welfare system. He said should have been saying “Labour – the party of work – the clue is in the name ... I want to teach my kids that it is wrong to be idle on benefits, when you can work.” Keeble says: “Along with a credible leader we need a big picture that will appeal beyond our core vote. With the collapse of the Lib Dems, the voters we need to reach are now embedded in the Tory and Ukip ranks. We lost the argument over linking the contribution people make to society and what they take out in cash or kind. Tory attacks, however unfounded, on our record of welfare spending were corrosive.” Asato says: “Labour is neither trusted to run services efficiently or to reform them effectively where needed. Arguments for increased funding, now desperately needed, fall on deaf ears because we ‘wasted’ taxpayers’ money last time.” She reveals voters greeted some its campaign pledges with incredulity: “‘You can’t guarantee I will get to see my !’ or ‘ – you’ll only get that many if they’re all immigrants. My daughter won’t get a look in.’” She says: “If the government shuts a service or sells it off, we need to be clear with people about whether we will reinstate it, or let it go. People understand that you cannot get everything back once it has gone, but they hate prevarication.” Billington, who lost in a three way fight with Ukip and the Tories, says: “We need to push further out of our comfort zone and talk about the cultural impact of immigration and the way some communities have changed rapidly over the past few decades.” She adds: “The fact is we have been frightened to have the conversations, so the conversations have gone on without us. If we re-enter those conversations without opening them up, we will end up sounding like we are defending the status quo. “And the status quo is leaving far too many working people behind for us to think it is our preferred option. But the reality is whatever we said did not pass the smell test of leadership, competence or sincerity based on people’s experience of those in power.” Frith, who lost Bury North by the narrowest of margins, says: “Despite all this public engagement, we were always up against an assumption that . This read across to many as also being anti-private sector worker and too pro-welfare. At this election, our proposition was all opposition. We spoke of all we’d stop and little of what we’d start. Our offer was a complaint. A no deal. “We rightly spoke of and wrongly said nothing to those working long hours. So as we jostle and jockey for a way ahead let’s make sure, well before next time, that we show we have the interests not just of those in need of a payday but those responsible for making payroll.”	Politics
9129	9130	Alex Salmond challenged to ‘put up or shut up’ over plans for general election 	 has been challenged to “put up or shut up” after he fuelled speculation that he plans to stand for Westminster again after stepping down as Scotland’s first minister. After several weeks of hints that he wants to return to the Commons in May’s general election after a five year absence, Salmond again teased his opponents at Holyrood during his resignation statement on Tuesday. With rumours growing that he plans to stand in Gordon, north of Aberdeen, a Commons seat which includes parts of his current Holyrood seat in Aberdeenshire East, Salmond implied again that he could be a kingmaker at Westminster if Labour failed to win a majority in May. Referring to his first term running a minority government at Holyrood, Salmond said he “had absolutely no idea whether my experience of minority government in this place will come in handy in another place”. But Christine Jardine, the Lib Dem candidate selected to replace Sir Malcolm Bruce, retiring after 32 years as the Lib Dem MP for Gordon, accused Salmond of toying with his constituents in Aberdeenshire East. “It’s time to stop the speculation and stop playing us all along with this game,” Jardine said. “The people of Aberdeenshire East who he represents at Holyrood have the right to know whether he’s going to abandon them to campaign for Westminster. “They voted for him and expect him to be their representative until 2016: they have a right to know what his intentions are. If he does want to stand in Gordon, it’s time for him to put up and shut up, because this is getting a bit tiring.” Pointing to a rash of dire polling results for the Lib Dems, a spokesman for Salmond said: “The Lib Dems will just have to contain themselves – they are obviously panicking and no wonder. The latest poll shows that the Lib Dems would lose every seat in apart from Orkney and Shetland – and the SNP are poised to do extremely well, even before we have all our candidates in place.” Salmond retired as Scotland’s longest serving first minister – first taking office in May 2007 – and as the UK’s longest serving party leader on Tuesday. He is widely expected to stand for Westminster, aiming to lead the push for much greater power for Holyrood. He previously held Gordon at Holyrood, before the Scottish parliamentary constituency’s abolition in 2011. His last official act before his former deputy Nicola Sturgeon takes over as first minister on Wednesday will be to watch Tuesday evening’s Scotland versus England friendly game at Celtic Park in Glasgow. Although an SNP overall majority at Holyrood is enough to assure Sturgeon’s election, the Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson is expected to stand as first minister too, to present a formal challenge. Sturgeon stood as SNP leader unopposed. The SNP has seen record-breaking polling support in the past two weeks and watched its membership more than triple to 86,000 people, despite losing the September referendum. The latest poll, by Survation for the Daily Record, showed on Tuesday that the – its highest ever by Survation, compared with 6% for the Lib Dems and 24% for Labour. Jardine said Salmond was far more unpopular than the polls suggested and would face a far harder fight than the SNP’s national ratings implied. Although Salmond has been an MP and MSP for several Aberdeenshire seats since 1987, and many other SNP MPs hold north Scotland seats, the region voted no heavily in the independence referendum, by two to one against in many areas. Jardine insisted that the Lib Dems had a secure majority in Gordon: “I respect the man but I’m not afraid of him. People in this area are pretty fed up with the way they’ve been treated by the SNP: they have told him ‘no’ once recently, and they’ll tell him ‘no’ again.”	Politics

A student, known only as Abby, caused a Twitter storm after declaring herself leader of the #milifandom – a group of enthusiastic admirers. Fandoms are usually reserved for the likes of Justin Bieber and One Direction, but the #milifandom hashtag has been trending, with scores of young females sharing their affection for the leader. Abby says the Milifandom, which started last week, is “a movement against the distorted media portrayal of Ed”. Since then, she has reached 12,000 followers on , with tweeters using the hashtag to express their support. One tweeter described having an “unexplainable emotional connection” to the Labour leader, while others posted pictures of the politician with a crown of flowers. 💜🌼ed miliband flower crown edits🌼💜 Caity later tweeted to say she was supposed to be revising. if I ever met ed miliband I could die happy tbh, he's cool The real question is, who isn't a part of the ?

5366	5367	Boris Johnson tries to distance himself from idea of driverless London buses 	"Replacing London's driver-operated buses with driverless vehicles would provide large cost savings as part of a ""paradigm shift"" in the way people travel, according to a controversial passage in . However, the loosely worded job-cutting suggestion had to be swiftly disowned by the mayor's office on Thursday, even though the document in which the futuristic idea was aired was published in support of Johnson's 2050 transport plan the day before. Discussing trends in transport, the document supporting the plan heralded a future in which buses might glide around the capital with no drivers – there are currently 22,500 of them – a generation after conductors largely disappeared across most of London's bus routes. It said that driverless technology of the type being developed by Google would provide ""large cost savings for buses while delivering a faster more efficient service,"" and added that it would become possible to provide what it called ""taxi like"" services ""at reduced costs"". A day after the document was published, the mayor's office moved to distance itself from the remarks. A spokesman said ""there are no plans for automated buses"" in the capital, and that any references to ""autonomous vehicles"" in the report ""should be seen in the context of automation on the tube"". Controversy about driverless technology is nothing new in , where there has been a long battle to introduce automation on the underground. promised in 2012 to introduce driverless trains to the underground, in a bid to reduce the power of the trade unions and end what he described as ""pointless"" tube strikes. Currently only the Docklands Light Railway runs with no drivers in London, although that network still requires a member of staff on each train for safety. The Victoria line is viewed by some transport observers as the most likely candidate for a driverless ""upgrade"", because it already uses an automatic system that performs all the functions of the driver, except for the opening and closing of the doors. Under the heading ""Will vehicles still need drivers?"", the supporting document nevertheless continues elaborating the benefits of autonomous vehicles: ""helping us reach our goal of eliminating death and injury on the roads … offering a convenient alternative to private ownership, reducing the demand for parking … [and] extending access to opportunities for the young, elderly and those with mobility difficulties."" Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association, said that he was ""dubious"" that the outlined visions will come to pass. ""We don't have a lot of confidence in anything that comes out of , to be honest, and the fact that they're suggesting it means it's almost certainly likely not to happen. ""Who knows with technology, but some of the simplest things, they still can't do. The best example is voice recognition technology. ""If you've got it on your car … it's rubbish. If you've got it on your phone, it's probably worse. They're all crap, aren't they? None of them work, and they can't even get that right. And they expect people to get into driverless cars?"" This week, the business secretary, Vince Cable, said the government would aim to promote driverless cars in Britain, as he announced a review of the laws that make them illegal and promised to allow their testing in three cities next year. Ministers also created a £10m fund to support the development of British technology in the area. In early July, a transport expert with the ear of City Hall published a study calling for driverless buses in the capital. Professor David Begg's report, ""A 2050 Vision for London"", was commissioned by advertising firm ClearChannel, and had a foreword from Peter Hendy, TfL's commissioner. Begg wrote that ""the same technology that will bring autonomous cars will make bus operations better. When buses have the same autonomous, communicating power that cars will have, they will be able to drive safely much closer to each other, too. ""Picture a dedicated bus rapid transit lane with moving buses queued up end-to-end. In this world, cars may start to function like buses, but buses could come to work like trains. And they are a lot cheaper to deploy."" Begg also predicted the end of taxi driving as a career. ""Taxi fares are expensive in London. One of the main costs is the wage/return to taxi drivers. Passengers in an AV world will be able to remotely call a driverless taxi to take them to and from their destination … ""The great promise of autonomous cars is not that we could each own one – the 21st century's version of owning your own Model T, or your own colour TV, or your own PC – but that no one would need to own one at all."""

1861	1862	Baftas 2014: Gravity nudges out Slave and Hustle 	Gravity, Alfonso Cuaron's space thriller starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney leads the pack of nominations at this year's Bafta awards, taking 11 nominations to the 10 for Steve McQueen's 12 Years a Slave. The classification of Gravity as a British film, while Slave's backing by Plan B, Brad Pitt's outfit, means it is deemed American, looks to have made the difference, with scoring nods in both best film and best British film. Cuaron's film also picked up a huge raft of technical nominations, while McQueen's performed well in more traditional acting and script categories. Meanwhile David O'Russell's American Hustle, did much better than at the , where it scored just two. At the Baftas, it's also in the running for 10 awards. The dark horse was Paul Greengrass's , which has been a quiet performer so far in the awards season but which is up for nine Baftas. Stephen Frears' Philomena performed marginally less well than predicted, with just four nominations, while Saving Mr Banks and Liberace biopic Behind the Candelabra both edged ahead of it with five. That latter film could do especially well in the UK as British voters may especially relish being able honour a film ineligible for cinema awards in the US, where it only had a TV release - although Michael Douglas was omitted from the leading actor field. Meanwhile, there was disappointment for Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, which scored just one nomination, for outstanding British film, while Ralph Fiennes's The Invisible Woman was only recognised for costume design and August: Osage County for supporting actress (for Julia Roberts). Nebraska, Alexander Payne's much-Oscar-tipped road movie took only three nominations, while Spike Jonze's similarly acclaimed Her went home empty handed. Significant surprises included a best actress nomination for Amy Adams in American Hustle, as well as a supporting nod for Bradley Cooper in that same film, and Oprah Winfrey as supporting actress in Lee Daniels' The Butler. Jared Leto was not mentioned as best supporting actor for his work in The Dallas Buyers Club, as had been anticipated; likewise Jonah Hill for The Wolf of Wall Street. Best foreign language and best documentary nominees followed a predicted path, although Joshua Oppenheimer's The Act of Killing was named in both categories. The nominees for the Bafta rising star award were , with Dane DeHaan, George MacKay and Will Poulter batttling it out against 12 Years a Slave's Lupita Nyong'o and Blue is the Warmest Colour star Léa Seydoux.

The Oscar-winning film-makers will rewrite an initial draft of the story, based on Seabiscuit author Laura Hillenbrand's 2010 novel Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption. Zamperini, a one-time Olympic track star, made headlines after surviving for 47 days without food or water when his US airforce plane crash-landed in the Pacific in 1943. Having endured shark attacks, aerial attacks and extreme hunger, he was eventually picked up by the Japanese after getting washed ashore on an island behind enemy lines. Zamperini's captors imprisoned him for two years, during which time he was tortured. He survived the ordeal and is now 96. Universal has been working on bringing Zamperini's story to the big screen for a number of years. The studio picked up the rights to Hillenbrand's book in 2011, with the aim of hiring director Francis Lawrence. Jolie came on board in December and reportedly conducted a meticulous search for screenwriters to rework an existing draft by William Nicholson and Richard LaGravenese. She could have not have scored a more impressive coup than hiring the Coens, who have two Oscar screenwriting wins for and , and have been nominated five times.

The film's plot echoes the events surrounding Martin's death following a late-night encounter with Zimmerman on 26 February last year. Starring The Wire's Michael B Jordan and Oscar-winner Octavia Spencer (The Help) and directed by 27-year-old first time feature film-maker Ryan Coogler, Fruitvale Station details how 22-year-old Oscar Grant was shot and killed by transport policeman Johannes Mehserle at the Fruitvale train station in Oakland, California, in the early hours of New Year's Day, 2009. The incident happened after Mehserle and another officer were called to reports of a fight. The policeman's move to restrain Grant and subsequent decision to shoot him in the back were captured by passers-by on mobile phones. Mehserle was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter, though not guilty of second-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter, a verdict which sparked protests and . He argued that he had intended to tase Grant, but accidentally shot him after seeing him reach for his waistband. The victim was unarmed. Fruitvale Station is being released by Harvey Weinstein's Weinstein Company in the US and is tipped for Oscars success next year. Weinstein has produced dozens of awards-season favourites over the past 20 years, including the Oscar-winning civil rights themed drama (for which Spencer win best supporting actress) in 2011 and the forthcoming White House-set political biopic . Coogler's film achieved the highest per-screen average gross of any movie released in the US this weekend, with a take of $54,000 (£36,000) on limited release at seven cinemas. ""Obviously, we had no idea of what would be going on at the time we dated the movie, but it's very topical,"" said The Weinstein Company's Erik Lomis. Jordan said he almost cancelled an appearance at a sold-out screening at Los Angeles at the weekend following the news of Zimmerman's acquittal. ""My heart hurts so bad right now. I wasn't going to come after I found out about George Zimmerman getting acquitted. It broke me up,"" . ""That's why I think this film means so much, because it keeps happening again and again.

13778	13779	Japan 2-2 USA (Japan win 3-1 on penalties) 	"Japan became the first Asian nation to win the Women's World Cup, beating USA in a penalty shoot-out. The USA missed their first three penalties, and were crowned world champions when Saki Kumagai slotted her spot-kick high past the USA goalkeeper, Hope Solo. It was a sad end for the , who were just three minutes away from becoming the first country to lift the cup three times, only for Japan to equalise for the second time in a thrilling final. The 32-year-old Japan captain, Homare Sawa, flicked a corner through a jumble of players and past Solo in the 117th minute to take the contest to penalties. Japan had scored late in normal time to force extra time. ""We ran and ran – we were exhausted but we kept running,"" said Sawa, the top scorer in the tournament with five goals. ""Not one of the players gave up,"" the coach, Norio Sasaki, said. ""The penalty kicks are always a 50-50% chance."" Japan's goalkeeper, Ayumi Kaihori, did more than her part, saving the first penalty from Shannon Boxx with a foot and swatting away the third kick from the substitute Tobin Heath. In between, Carli Lloyd skied her shot over the bar. The USA coach, Pia Sundhage, was perplexed and could not find an explanation for the penalty misses. ""Sometimes in, sometimes out,"" she said. Sawa received the trophy and immediately went into a huddle with her players, a multitude of hands cradling the trophy, a symbol of the nation's teamwork. Japan were always driven by a greater purpose, hoping their success at the World Cup could provide some emotional relief for a nation still reeling from the effect of 11 March earthquake and tsunami. The team displayed a banner reading ""To our Friends Around the World – Thank You for Your Support"" before the final, and Sasaki inspired his players before the quarter-final by showing them pictures of the devastation. After dominating play from the start, the USA went ahead in the 69th minute when Megan Rapinoe's long ball over the top sent Alex Morgan clear, and the substitute hustled past Saki Kumagai to slot home with angled shot from 15 yards. Against the run of play, Japan scored a goal out of nothing in the 81st minute when the American defenders Rachel Buehler and Alex Krieger failed to clear, allowing Japan's Aya Miyama to sneak in and slot home from close range. The USA regained the lead in the 104th minute when Morgan sent a pinpoint cross to the towering Wambach. The forward did not even have to get off the ground to head past the goalkeeper, Ayumi Kaihori, from six yards. The goal gave Wambach four for the tournament, and it looked good enough for the title, until Japan and their brilliant captain provided a late twist that was hard for the USA players to take and they then faltered in the penalty shoot-out. ""It's obviously heartbreaking,"" Wambach said. ""Japan played well, they never gave up."""	Football
11972	11973	Football - Champions League final: Final twist brings United glory again 	 are once more engulfed in the delirious joy of Champions League melodrama. They were on the verge of defeat in the shoot-out as the Chelsea captain, John Terry, came up to take the penalty that would have taken the trophy to Stamford Bridge. His standing foot slipped as he struck the ball and the effort flew wide. A failure by Cristiano Ronaldo had been cancelled out. The momentum was irreversibly United's and, in the end, Edwin van der Sar ensured that the trophy would come to Old Trafford for the third time by saving the spot kick from the substitute Nicolas Anelka. This is a club that cannot come by glory in this tournament until it has scared itself senseless. The Luzhniki Stadium witnessed a spectacle to compare with the comeback in 1999 when Bayern Munich were overtaken at the close of the final. The memorability of such a moment depends as well on the images of the losers' pain. Terry had been magnificent and, 11 minutes into extra-time, had somehow twisted his neck to head away a shot by the substitute Ryan Giggs that was bound for the net. It seemed inconceivable then that such a character could be brought low. He is no culprit. The single person meriting blame is Didier Drogba, sent off four minutes from the close of extra-time for aiming a slap at the United centre-half Nemanja Vidic following a mêlée after Chelsea had expected the ball to be returned to them at a throw-in. That folly by the Ivorian did not mar one of the most engrossing finals of modern times. Its main side effect was to promote Terry to taking the fifth penalty. There is always a craving to consecrate winners as deserving of their prize. It is tempting to do that because, in the first half particularly, they scored, wasted openings and were thwarted by the goalkeeper Petr Cech. That was an outstanding spell but Chelsea's self-belief was also imposing. At times they appeared ready to overpower Sir Alex Ferguson's team. The Scot declared this to be the first major shoot-out to have gone his way, dismissing the bauble of the Community Shield that was won in just such a fashion, against , at the start of this season. Ferguson has now conquered in all four of his European finals since the days with Aberdeen. It might all have been different in Moscow. Drogba had struck the woodwork in the 78th minute and Lampard would do likewise in stoppage-time. Nothing, it appears, goes in favour of the Chelsea manager, Avram Grant, for long. The Israeli could well have imagined that his luck was turning when his team came through an initial bombardment. Now there will be more uncertainty and disquiet. Terry's failure from the spot brought a gesture of wry exasperation from Roman Abramovich. The owner will ask himself if he is employing an unlucky manager or one who falls a little short of what is needed. Either way the Russian, deliberating in Moscow last night, cannot ignore the fact that Chelsea have failed to take a trophy for the first time in four seasons. Nor would he have liked the way in which United initially took his side by surprise. To Chelsea's regret it turned out that it is possible for one of these teams to surprise the other. United did more still, disconcerting the opposition with tactics that helped Ronaldo score against these adversaries for the first time in his career. United had been sent out in a 4-4-2 formation that some might have supposed had been stashed in the Old Trafford museum. The purpose of it was to exploit the narrowness of Chelsea's 4-3-3 system and bedevil the full-backs. Michael Essien was the principal target. Accustomed as the midfielder is to operating on the right of the defence, he has no experience of the suffering to which Ronaldo subjected him. The winger had left him utterly stranded in one incident and then embarrassed him more severely with the opener in the 27th minute. Paul Scholes exchanged passes with Wes Brown on the right and the latter stroked an unexpectedly good inswinging cross with his left foot. Ronaldo skipped in front of a static Essien to glide a perfect header low into the net. It was a bruising encounter, with Scholes, for instance, requiring attention to a bloodied nose after a crash between himself and Claude Makelele that led to a yellow card for each of them. All the same United were not diverted from performing with freedom. Owen Hargreaves brought his running power to bear from right midfield, the position in which he got his earlier Champions League winners' medal with Bayern Munich in 2001. Ten minutes before half-time United should have been in a virtually unassailable position but Petr Cech parried Carlos Tevez's header and then reached Michael Carrick's shot from that rebound. There was a further opportunity nine minutes later when Tevez could not quite get to the low ball by Wayne Rooney that had eluded Makelele. Nonetheless United by then had been given a clue as to Chelsea's powers of recovery. When Drogba headed a deep cross into the centre after 34 minutes Rio Ferdinand, under pressure from Michael Ballack, knocked it towards his own net, only for Van der Sar to tip the ball on to the bar. Chelsea had their fortune when pulling level. Essien's 25-yarder cannoned of Vidic and then Ferdinand to set up Lampard for a coolly taken goal. Though Chelsea had been rallying, their feelings much have contained a measure of relief. It invigorated the team thereafter. Each side took the other to its limits.	Football
5225	5226	Samsung plans smartphone overhaul after profits plunge 	 Electronics has vowed to overhaul its mobile phone handset lineup after profit from smartphones tumbled last quarter to the lowest in more than three years. The South Korean firm, which climbed from smartphone laggard to top seller in the past three years, had prided itself on responding quickly to market demand and tailoring handsets to the needs of users and mobile carriers around the world. But its rapid success with a product category pioneered by rival Apple is undergoing an equally stunning reversal. Earnings from Samsung’s mobile phone business began declining this year, undermined by lukewarm sales of the Galaxy S5 smartphone and an onslaught from cheaper local brands in China and India. Apple also eroded Samsung’s leading market share in developed nations. In a rare acknowledgement of a misstep, Samsung’s head of investor relations told an earnings conference call that the firm had lagged behind changing market conditions. The company’s response “was not quick enough”, said the executive, Robert Yi. Samsung plans a significant change in smartphone strategy for next year to seek more “efficiency”, implying a reduction in the number of new handset models . That will allow the company to better focus on each product and to purchase components at cheaper prices to save costs. Unlike Apple’s take-it-or-leave-it approach, Samsung boasted it gave more choice to consumers, launching at least two significant models a year and making smartphones in a variety of screen sizes and various features. The drop in earnings from the mobile business battered the South Korean company’s quarterly net profit, which tumbled 49% to 4.2tn won (£2.5bn). That was the lowest since the first quarter of 2012, but above market expectations. Operating income from its mobile business, which had contributed more than 60% of its entire earnings, fell to 1.75tn won from 6.7tn won a year earlier. Quarterly sales fell 20% to 47.4tn won while operating income shrank 60% to 4.1tn won. Samsung that its handset profit had declined despite a marginal increase in shipments. Analysts said the Galaxy S5 smartphone launched in April did not sell well while many consumers held off upgrading their phones, waiting instead for new iPhones. “High-end smartphone sales result was somewhat weak,” said Kim Hyun-joon, senior vice-president at Samsung’s mobile communications business. “We will fundamentally reform our product portfolio.” Samsung retained its leading position in the global smartphone market during the third quarter, but it was the only top five handset vendor to record a sales decline. Apple, Xiaomi, Lenovo and LG Electronics all experienced more than 15% growth. Samsung’s shipments fell 8% to 78.1m smartphones in the third quarter and its market share eroded to 24% from 33% a year earlier. Samsung’s rise to the world’s top smartphone maker was largely thanks to its early bet on Google’s Android operating system. But with other handset makers catching up in performance, features and design, Samsung is facing pressure to add an impressive and differentiating new feature to its phones. One of its answers was the Galaxy Note Edge smartphone with a curved side screen that can display icons, news flashes or weather. But with a limited supply of curved displays, Edge smartphone production will remain small. It went on sale in Japan and this month. The company gave little detail about how it would differentiate new smartphones’ software or user experience. On the hardware front, Samsung said flexible displays and a metal case will help its phones stand out. With a plunge in smartphone profit, Samsung is increasingly relying on semiconductors. For the first time since the third quarter of 2011, the semiconductor division reported a larger quarterly profit – 2.3tn won – than the mobile communication division.	Business
9824	9825	Panorama care home abuse investigation prompts government review 	"The government has ordered a review of the Care Quality Commission's (CQC) failure to investigate a whistleblower's account of the systematic abuse that left vulnerable people to face months of physical and verbal abuse at a care home. Paul Burstow, the social care minister, has asked the regulator to investigate similar services to the Winterbourne View unit, in Hambrook, near Bristol, where a culture of abuse prevailed despite tip-offs from staff and repeated inspections – the role of the CQC, which is the sector regulator, and the local authority. A committee of MPs will also question CQC chiefs over their responsibilities. Stephen Dorrell, the chair of the Commons health committee, said a scheduled hearing with CQC bosses on 22 June will now focus on the organisation's failings in the case. The systematic abuse of residents in the unit was on Tuesday. Staff pinned residents to the floor and forced one into the shower fully dressed and then outside until she shook from cold. Residents were slapped and taunted, and one was teased about a suicide attempt. Experts told the programme what they had seen amounted to ""torture"". Immediately after the broadcast, four of the staff were arrested. The Commons health committee will also launch a more wide-ranging inquiry into the commissioning of social care in the autumn. The inquiry will examine how the state provides care facilities for the elderly and vulnerable adults, including the , which has slashed its rent payments in an effort to keep its 750 residential homes running. The future care of 31,000 elderly residents is in jeopardy if the firm collapses. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We are talking about a specific case that is clearly very shocking. Paul Burstow has asked the regulator to undertake a series of inspections of similar services and a thorough examination of the roles of both the CQC and local authorities in this case. ""What we need to do is look at the circumstances surrounding this particular case. Clearly, there have been failures in this case, and we need to look at that before drawing any conclusions."" He added that the government was ""monitoring very carefully"" the situation with Southern Cross. Dorrell told the Guardian that the inquiry would look broadly at the commissioning process, saying: ""The questions will be about how can these stories of abuse arise. ""There was Panorama yesterday, but also the report last week on care of the elderly in NHS hospitals, all the issues around Southern Cross and the CQC in particular. ""We are talking about 70% of patient load of the health service that is people with long-term needs and conditions, and so often we focus on waiting times for elective operations. This is a far bigger issue."" Responding specifically to the situation at the Bristol care home, he said: ""I do think, in general, these services are better than they were a generation ago. ""But there are still far too many failures. We have to address the reason for those failures. 30 years ago, the majority of this care was provided in large long-stay institutions which were themselves open to incidences of abuse. The vast majority are better now, but there are too many cases where it falls down."" Dorrell said he would be asking how the commissioning of such services worked. Castlebeck, the firm behind Winterbourne View, was charging more than £3,000 per resident a week. ""One of the groups of people with difficult questions to answer arising out of the specifics of this situation is the people who authorised the expenditure of that money,"" he added. ""Someone had to sign the cheque that the care home operator was being paid to provide a service of £3,000 per week. I presume the majority of those cases were paid for with public funds. The people who signed the cheque have a duty to make certain that standards are of an adequate nature."" The CQC and Castlebeck both issued full apologies for their respective failings over the Winterbourne View unit. The government has commissioned the economist and broadcaster Andrew Dilnot to conduct a wide-ranging inquiry into the funding of care and support for elderly and disabled adults. He is due to report in July. The autumn inquiry by the health committee in the Commons will focus on his findings as well as the specific cases highlighted by the Panorama programme, Southern Cross and the recent report by the CQC on the lack of care for the elderly in hospitals. The prime minister's spokesman said there had been discussions between Southern Cross and the Department of ""for some time"" over contingency funding planning. Asked about financial support in the light of council funding constraints, the prime minister's spokesman said Southern Cross, landlords and those with a stake in the business needed to put in place a plan to ensure the company was on a firm footing. ""That process is happening,"" he said. ""Our role is to ensure we keep in close contact with what is going on and keep monitoring that situation, and we will do what we need to do to ensure there is protection for anyone affected by this."" On the issue of bailout, he insisted the government would make sure ""there is protection in place"", adding: ""It may well not be in the interest of residents to move them, it may well be in their interest to keep them in the same place. ""But we have to look at that very carefully ... our interest is to make sure these people are cared for effectively."""	Politics

""This has resulted in a situation where around 15,000 individuals, many very elderly and vulnerable pensioners who rely on income from the bank's retail bonds and preference shares have had their interest deferred and are being threatened with the outcome of the resolution and total loss despite them having no control or influence over the success of the bank's plan,"" Taber wrote.

2960	2961	Labour pledges to repeal Lobbying Act in transparency drive 	"Labour has announced that it will repeal the Act if it wins power, in an attempt to make elections and lobbying of government more transparent. The act has been dubbed the ""gagging law"" by charities for restrictions it places on their ability to campaign in election periods. The shadow leader of the Commons, Angela Eagle, said on Thursday that if won the next election it would protect freedom of speech for charities in elections, as well as regulate the lobbying industry and get rid of big money from politics. It is relatively rare for Labour to say it will repeal a specific piece of government legislation, partly because shadow ministers know there will be a huge demand for legislative time if Labour is elected. The legislation was supposed to bring transparency into lobbying but it has faced intense criticism from charities who say that the restrictions it places on how much they can spend on campaigns during election periods amount to a gagging clause. The bill received royal assent in February, and in June the Electoral Commission is due to issue clarifying guidance on how the act's provisions will work in practice. Despite concessions during the passage of the act, the alliance of charities that opposed the bill said the law ""will restrict the ability of many charities and campaigning groups to fulfil their core function on behalf of their supporters because campaigning ahead of elections will be restricted on a scale never before experienced"". The alliance added: ""The law is badly drafted and is ambiguous in its meaning."" Eagle said she would consult with charities to see what restrictions on campaigning were still needed. She said a Labour government would bring in a universal register of professional lobbyists that covered all lobbyists and not just the 1% covered by the current legislation, and there would be sanctions for firms that did not comply. She said that at present only firms that lobbied for a variety of clients were required to register. ""The lobbying laws had been cooked up in a shabby deal between David Cameron and Nick Clegg. It lets vested interests off the hook, and it gags charities and grassroots campaigners who want to hold the government to account,"" Eagle said. ""In the next parliament, we will introduce a universal register of all professional lobbyists backed by a code of conduct and sanctions. We will do what Cameron and Clegg didn't and consult with charities and campaigners about how to ensure transparency in our elections while protecting freedom of speech."" She said the government's reforms ""have achieved the feat of uniting both lobbyists and campaigners for lobbying transparency against them. Eagle said groups as disparate as the Taxpayers Alliance, the Royal British Legion, 38 Degrees and Friends of the Earth had opposed the laws, while the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency said the reforms were a box-ticking exercise. It is generally accepted that the new legislation excludes all in-house lobbyists working inside banks, energy firms, payday lenders, alcohol and tobacco companies, as well as corporate lobbyists in business lobby groups like the CBI. Lobbyists in those agencies that have direct contact with ministers will be required to list merely their clients. There will be no record of dealings with special advisers, civil servants or regulators; no information on what they are seeking to influence or what deals are being done; nor how much money is being spent to sway government. Senior lobbying groups including the Association of Professional Political Consultants recently issued a statement claiming the law remained unclear. They said the law needed clarifying by the Cabinet Office ""so that potential registrants are able to comply with the law. Our members want clarity on the exact nature of activity that will trigger the requirement to register and about the cost of registration""."	Politics
414	415	Robin Williams obituary 	"When the notion of getting in touch with one's inner child entered popular currency, the standup comedian and actor , who has died aged 63 in a suspected suicide, was ripe to be its poster-boy. Partly it was his limitless energy and floodlight smile, or the frantic chatter that made it sound as if he were constantly interrupting himself or speaking in tongues. But he also resembled strongly a hirsute toddler who had broken out of the playpen to make whoopee. Many of his most popular performances were as child-men rampaging through the prissy adult world. His breakthrough came as the naïve extra-terrestrial in the US sitcom Mork & Mindy, which ran from 1978 to 1982. For that part, the red-and-silver costume that he donned for a monologue at the end of each episode even resembled an infant's romper suit. In Good Morning, Vietnam (1987), he played the real-life DJ , whose in the face of war made him a hit with American troops. A swerve into straighter acting, as the at a stuffy school in the late-1950s in Dead Poets Society (1989), did not upset this trend. Instead, he transferred deftly his comic skills into a dramatic setting as his character liberated pupils formerly rigid with obedience. Williams did not need to be visible on screen to continue his campaign of disinhibition: some of his most pure and untamed work was as the voice of the Genie in Disney's Aladdin (1992), for which he improvised the lion's share of his dialogue while the animators worked around his ad-libs. Any magic that film exudes is largely down to him. It was with a certain inevitability that Williams was cast as the boy who was supposed never to grow up, but did, in Steven Spielberg's Peter Pan sequel Hook (1992), and as a child with an ageing disorder that made him appear to be an adult in Francis Ford Coppola's Jack (1996). Had these movies been better, or more beloved, they might have been known as Williams's signature roles. That status should go instead to his deranged, emotionally naked (and sometimes physically naked) performance in Terry Gilliam's The Fisher King (1991) as a homeless man whose search for the Holy Grail is born out of trauma. He was Oscar-nominated for that, as well as for Good Morning, Vietnam and Dead Poets Society; he finally won for playing a bereaved therapist in Good Will Hunting (1997). But no performer who had been through the extreme addictions and depression that Williams had (and about which he was candid in his standup routines and interviews) could fail to be aware of his own capacity for darkness. It was this that he gradually began to draw on in a run of serious and even abrasive parts which made the latter stages of his career arguably the most interesting (if the least amusing). Chief among these was Christopher Nolan's Insomnia (2002), in which he played a suspected murderer hunted by a cop (played by Al Pacino). In the same year, he also starred as a children's entertainer driven to madness when he is usurped by a younger rival in the bitter comedy Death to Smoochy, and as a lonely photo-counter employee who develops an unhealthy obsession with a family in the thriller One Hour Photo. Though he had not forsaken lighter material altogether, the impression was unmistakably that of a clown wiping off his makeup to show the tears underneath. Williams was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Laura, a fashion model, and Robert, a senior executive at Ford Motor Company. He endured a lonely childhood in which he played mostly on his own in the large family home and was bullied at school for being overweight. The family moved to Marin County, California, when Williams was 16. He was then educated at Claremont Men's College, where he studied political science and also took improvisation acting classes. He went on to study acting, first at the and later at the Juilliard School, New York, from which he graduated in 1976. He auditioned for acting jobs but was forced to earn money instead working as a bartender and in an ice-cream parlour. After he began working the standup circuit in Los Angeles, he got early breaks on TV shows including The Richard Pryor Show and in a small part in the sex comedy Can I Do It 'Til I Need Glasses (1977). His zany audition for the small role of Mork in two episodes of the long-running sitcom Happy Days led the producer Garry Marshall to remark that Williams was the only alien to try out for the part: ""I will never forget the day I met him and he stood on his head in my office chair and pretended to drink a glass of water using his finger like a straw."" His instant popularity guaranteed a spin-off series in which he muddled through earthly life with the help of a sympathetic housemate played by Pam Dawber. ""The first season of Mork & Mindy I knew immediately that a three-camera format would not be enough to capture Robin and his genius talent,"" said Marshall. ""So I hired a fourth camera operator and he just followed Robin. Only Robin. Looking back, four cameras weren't enough. I should have hired a fifth camera to follow him too."" The show was a ratings hit, and Mork's nonsensical utterings, including his greeting ""Nanu-nanu"", became unlikely catchphrases. It was here that the child-like persona on which Williams's career was founded began to take shape. The actor's first major film role was as the lead in s live-action version of Popeye (1980). Despite being financed by Disney, this oddball musical was very much an Altman movie, throwing caution and sometimes coherence to the wind. But Williams, bearing engorged prosthetic forearms and sounding unintelligible at times with a pipe lodged in the corner of his mouth, was both perfect and hypnotically strange in the part, opposite Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl. In later films, he would be the eyecatching main attraction, ceding the spotlight to no one. Here, he was just one among many outlandish elements. In the pictures that immediately followed, he was positively restrained, as though not yet confident that his Morkishness could work in movies. He was the unassuming hero of an adaptation of John Irving's novel The World According to Garp (1982) and the least wacky participant in the desert-island comedy Club Paradise (1986). But he showed, as a newly fired executive who averts a robbery in The Survivors (1983) and as a Russian saxophonist defecting to the US in Moscow on the Hudson (1984), that his unpredictable but essentially comforting persona was flexible enough to work in a variety of settings. His first hit movie, Good Morning, Vietnam, followed soon after, cementing for cinemagoers an image of Williams to rival the one TV audiences had enjoyed in Mork. The film could be mawkish, as could Williams himself, but this was tempered by its authentic irreverence. The same could not be said of all Williams's later films. There had always been a needy aspect to even his most scabrous standup routines, and he was never a dangerous comic: inflammatory material was rendered essentially fireproof by those love-me eyes, that gurning grin. Cinema, with its aggrandising close-ups and urging, saccharine scores, could sometimes be his worst enemy. Dead Poets Society had its share of sappiness, not least in the climax in which the students climb onto their desks and salute Williams with Walt Whitman's line ""O Captain! My Captain!"" The star, to his credit, underplayed admirably. This was not the case in those films that earned him a reputation as a sentimentalist. He twinkled unstoppably throughout Awakenings (1990), in which he played Dr Malcolm Sayer, based loosely on Dr Oliver Sacks, and in Toys (1992), where he was the pure-hearted saviour of a toy factory. Mrs Doubtfire (1993) provided an opportunity for Williams to let rip anarchically as a father bonding with his estranged children by posing as their Scottish nanny. That also gave him another smash-hit. But he was pimping for tears and goosebumps again as a man exploring the afterlife in What Dreams May Come, as a doctor trying to prove that laughter is the best medicine in Patch Adams (both 1998), as a simpering android in Bicentennial Man and as a Jewish shopkeeper fostering hope in the ghettoes of Nazi-occupied Poland in Jakob the Liar (both 1999). Williams had also been forging a separate career as a pillar of family entertainment in adventures such as Jumanji (1995) and Flubber (1997). This continued when he played Teddy Roosevelt in two Night at the Museum films (2006 and 2009); a third, in which he also appears, is due for release later this year. His decision to branch out into more challenging material in the early 2000s came directly after a stretch of ingratiating parts. But unlike, say, Bill Murray's transformation into an indie icon after Lost in Translation, Williams's work in films such as Insomnia felt for all its sincerity like a graft that did not take. His image as a human teddy-bear persisted even after he made World's Greatest Dad (2009), a film he admired greatly, in which he played a father who fabricates his son's diaries after the boy dies in an auto-erotic accident. Williams's attempts to kill off his cutesy persona were very much of the one-step-forward, two-steps-back variety. For every World's Greatest Dad or One Hour Photo, there were many more like the lacklustre comedies RV: Runaway Vacation (2006) or Old Dogs (2009). He was, however, a surprising addition to the cast of The Butler (2013), in which he played Eisenhower. Williams's work-rate in the last decade was arrested by health problems and by occasional relapses into addiction, the most recent of which incurred a spell in rehab. He had returned to standup in 2008 with a show entitled , though this was interrupted briefly by surgery to replace an aortic valve. ""You appreciate little things,"" he said after that procedure, ""like walks on the beach with a defibrillator."" He is survived by his third wife, Susan Schneider, whom he married in 2011; his son Zachary, from his first marriage, to Valerie Velardi, which ended in divorce; and by his daughter, Zelda, and son, Cody, from his second marriage, to Marsha Garces, which ended in divorce.

1079	1080	British labour market may be too flexible, Vince Cable says 	"The business secretary, , has warned that the British labour market has become too flexible – leading to entrenched low wages and low productivity. His remarks in a speech to the Resolution Foundation are the most serious acknowledgement yet by a senior government figure that structural flaws in the UK labour market may be holding back living standards despite the return of economic growth. He said: ""The recession has brought to light problems that we need to resolve. We have to confront the possibility that labour markets may be becoming too flexible. Too much flexibility, and we undermine the incentive to be more productive."" He warns: ""The question now, as growth strengthens, is how to improve the labour market so that we continue to have an economy that creates jobs and can respond to change, but allows real wage growth. We do not want to reproduce the American experience, where – over a decade – wages have stagnated, even in a period of economic growth."" He concedes government policy has played a role in creating a flexible labour market leading to a flood of labour on to the market willing to work at very low wages. He points out: ""The combination of benefits reforms, our cutting taxes on labour through raising the threshold, and other reforms like abolishing the default retirement age means that the incentives to work, particularly in low-skilled jobs, have never been sharper. But when this coincides with firms not – yet – investing strongly, the outcome could be an entrenchment of low-productivity jobs."" He says arguments about zero-hours contracts are finely balanced but the scale of their growth, and instances of exploitation point to the need for reform. He rejects the Labour plan to give employees a full secure contract if they have been working on the same zero-hours contract for a year. He also calls for a strengthening of the institutional machinery around the minimum wage. Cable says: ""The minimum wage only applies to 5% of the labour force, but it influences the way we look at low pay as a whole."" He suggests stronger powers of enforcement and clearer expectations that the Low Pay Commission should be aiming to increase wages in real terms. Discussing zero hours contracts, Cable said: ""There is a lot of evidence of abuse, with some employers taking advantage of a weak labour market to impose poor, insecure conditions with minimal commitment or training."" He said the predominant abuse is exclusivity contracts where employees cannot work for any other employer. Cable described this as ""intrinsically unreasonable"", adding his favoured solution was a new legal right to request a fixed-hours contract. Cable also questioned the trend to self-employment. He said ""self-employment accounts for 80% of the – remarkable –increase in employment since 2007. According to Morgan Stanley, half of those gains are part-time (though, in the last year, job growth has been in full-time employment) and there has been a huge boost from older people working beyond retirement age. Closer examination suggests that these jobs are becoming lower paid, and that the numbers of self-employed firms that actually hire staff has declined. "" Overall, he argued that ""wage growth has been under pressure because of a quite astonishing increase in labour supply. The total workforce has been growing at around 1% a year, and there has been an ever growing willingness to work at lower wages"". He said: ""There is a barely remarked upon transformation in the basic shape of the recovery we expected, and one that is less favourable for living standards across the income distribution."" He pointed out that following the 2008-09 crisis there was lower growth in wages and faster growth in prices. "" At the beginning of this government, the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast that the situation would ease over the next few years. But instead of wages outpacing RPI inflation by 2%, as they earlier forecast, they are now barely expected to keep pace."""	Politics
4638	4639	Roberto Mancini writes farewell letter to 'incredible' Sir Alex Ferguson 	"Roberto Mancini sent a letter to Sir Alex Ferguson to offer the manager his best wishes following the announcement that Ferguson is to retire at the end of the season. The manager would not be drawn on the details of what he wrote to Ferguson. ""Yeah, I sent a message. I sent a letter,"" he said. ""It is private and confidential."" But Mancini, an admirer of Ferguson, did reveal that his standout memories of the Scot come from the 12 matches between their teams since the Italian arrived in England. He said: ""Every derby was fantastic. Also when we lost. It is normal you think about the derby . I think that it is impossible, I don't think there is another tie like this or can be another tie like this; 6-1 at Old Trafford against United is a good memory for us. Also when we lost because we play every game at the same level. , they were better than us. Every derby is a good memory."" Asked where Ferguson ranks among the great managers, Mancini said: ""This is difficult. Everyone can have his opinion but one manager who stays for 27 years in the same club and won every trophy for 27 years is an incredible situation. I don't think there will be another manager like him. In Europe, there are other good managers. I don't know if you can say Sir Alex is the best but he is the best in the last 27 years."" William Hill have installed City as the 11-8 favourites for next season's Premier League title, with the champions second at 7-4 under David Moyes. Would Ferguson's departure make it easier for Mancini? ""I don't think this. A top club, a big club like United, you can change the manager. Sir Alex built this team but it is a big club with a big history and I don't think it will change something,"" he said. Mancini's City have managed only a single win in eight attempts against Moyes's Everton, losing six of those games. Mancini joked that he hoped it was Everton rather than Moyes who City found tricky. ""Our problem is Everton. I don't know, we will see next year. I think he is a good manager,"" he said. Throughout City's run to the FA Cup final against Wigan Athletic, Mancini has chosen Costel Pantilimon instead of Joe Hart as the goalkeeper. Yet having stated earlier this week that the Romanian will retain his place, Mancini no longer seems certain. ""We didn't decide this for the final but we can be sure we have good players and Costel is a good keeper,"" he said. ""If we decide that we play Costel it is because we trust in him. It is not a big decision."" Of the threat that Wigan present, Mancini said: ""Every game we play against Wigan we had a problem. We never win easy. First of all because they try to play football always. Also when they are losing a game, they continue to play football because they want to attack with a lot of players and when they attack they are very dangerous. For this reason, this is the first problem we can have."" He believes Wigan's manager, Roberto Martínez, who is being mentioned as a replacement for Moyes, could thrive at a bigger club. ""Probably he deserves to, with all the respect that we have for Wigan,"" Mancini said. ""His chairman [Dave Whelan] is a fantastic man. I support Wigan [against relegation] and Sunderland because [Paolo] Di Canio is there. I hope that Sunderland [stay up] because Di Canio is manager and Wigan because I like his chairman and Roberto Martínez. I think Martínez can deserve also to manage a top team."""	Football
14082	14083	Libya: military action necessary, legal and right, says David Cameron 	"David Cameron told MPs it was ""necessary, legal and right"" to have instigated military action to stop brutalising his own people as the prime minister updated politicians on events ahead of a Commons vote on the situation. Cameron said the military action taken by British and coalition forces had ""largely neutralised"" Libya's air defences and helped avoid a ""bloody massacre"" in the rebel opposition stronghold of Benghazi ""in the nick of time"". The prime minister, who took a number of intervention from MPs during his speech, said the UN resolution did not provide legal authority to allow coalition forces to remove Gaddafi from power through military means. While the British government believed that Libya's future would be best without Gaddafi as leader, it would be up to the Libyan people to decide ""aided by the international community"", he said. The UN resolution was limited in its scope and ""explicitly does not provide legal authority for action to bring about Gaddafi's removal from power by military means … it is for the Libyan people to determine their government and their destiny,"" said Cameron. ""But our view is clear - there is no decent future for with Colonel Gaddafi remaining in power."" The prime minister told the Commons that all military targets must be ""fully consistent with the UN resolution"". Earlier on Monday there was confusion when the chief of the defence staff, General Sir David Richards, appeared to rule out directly targeting Gaddafi. Cameron told MPs: ""We therefore choose our targets to stop attacks on civilians and to implement the no-fly zone. But we should not give a running commentary on targeting and I do not propose to say any more than that."" He sought to reassure MPs concerned that ""mission creep"" could lead to a ground invasion or occupation of Libya by stressing that the government would ""stick to the terms of the UN resolution which absolutely and specifically rules out an occupying force"". ""We have to be clear,"" he went on. ""We are not talking about an invasion or an occupying force, we're talking about taking action to protect civilian life."" Downing Street has said that the attorney general's advice on the intervention will not itself be published in full, but it released a note summarising the legal justification for the conflict ahead of the Commons debate. The two aims of the strikes carried out against Gaddafi's forces by an international coalition, including a Royal Navy submarine and RAF aircraft, was to suppress the Libyan air defences and make possible the enforcement of a no-fly zone, and to protect civilians from attack by the Libyan leader's regime, said Cameron. ""Good progress has been made on both fronts. Coalition forces have largely neutralised Libyan air defences and as a result a no-fly zone has effectively been put in place over Libya. ""It is also clear that coalition forces have helped to avert what could have been a bloody massacre in Benghazi. In my view they did so just in the nick of time."" The submarine HMS Triumph and Tornado jets, flying from RAF Marham in Norfolk, were involved in the first strikes. Cameron told MPs that RAF Typhoons were being sent to southern Italy ""25 minutes' flying time from the Libyan coast"". He said these jets would be in action patrolling the no-fly zone on Monday afternoon. Cameron said military action had been taken following Gaddafi's failure to meet ""non-negotiable conditions"" set down in UN resolution 1973. ""Gaddafi has had every conceivable opportunity to stop massacring his own people and the time for red lines, threats, last chances is over. Tough action is needed now to ensure that people in Libya can lead their lives without fear and with access to the basic needs of life. That is what the [UN] security council requires, that is what we are seeking to deliver."" He added: ""Of course, there are difficulties and dangers ahead. But we already know, beyond any doubt, that we have succeeded in chasing Gaddafi's planes out of the sky, we have saved the lives of many Libyans, and we have helped to prevent the destruction of a great and historic city. Of course, no one can be certain of what the future can hold. But as we stand here today, the people of Libya have a much better chance of determining their destiny and in taking this action, we should be proud that we're not only acting in British interests but also being true to our values as a nation."" Cameron, who ruled out using depleted uranium and cluster bombs in Libya, said military action in the country was different from Britain's attack on Iraq in 2003, not just because it was backed by the legal authority of the UN, and the support of Arab countries, but also because many in the Arab world wanted to know that the international community ""care about their suffering"". ""The Arab world has asked us to act with them to stop this slaughter and that is why we should answer that call,"" he said. Cameron added: ""A successful outcome is the enforcement of the will of the UN, which is a cease of attacks on civilians. In Iraq, we had been prepared to go into a country, to knock over its government and put something else in place – that is not the approach we are taking here."" He said he wanted to internationalise this to the maximum degree possible both on military front but also ""what must follow"" in terms of humanitarian aid and assistance for the people of Libya. On Arab involvement, the prime minister conceded that no Arab planes have involved in the mission so far. But he said Qatar is producing a number of jets to help enforce the no-fly zone and the government would be doing ""everything we can to encourage others to come forward"". He added: ""I am as keen as anyone to make sure this coalition of the willing is as broad-based and has as much Arab support as possible. But we should be clear that, in the early stages, in order to act quickly, it had to have very strong American, British and French participation."" The prime minister said failure to act risked Libya turning into a pariah state festering on Europe's border, ""a source of instability, exporting terror beyond her borders"". ""So I am clear: taking action in Libya, together with our partners, is clearly in our national interest."" The prime minister received the support of the Labour leader, , who told the Commons that the ""three key criteria for action exist – it is a just cause, with a feasible mission, and it has international support."" Miliband compared leaving Libyans to their fate with failure to intervene in the Spanish civil war, saying: ""As we saw the defenceless people of Libya attacked by their own government, it would equally revolt the conscience of the world to know we could have done something to help them, yet chose not to."" He told MPs that military action may not lead to Gaddafi's removal, but standing by ""would be dereliction of our duty, of our history and of our values"". Miliband said Britain's air strikes on Serbia in 1999 to protect Kosovo's civilians saved tens of thousands of lives, adding: ""We didn't know how that would end."" ""Where there is just cause, where there is reasonable action that can be taken, where there is international consent – are we really saying we should be a country that stands by and does nothing?"" said the Labour leader. He added: ""That would be dereliction of our duty, of our history and of our values."""	Politics
10907	10908	George Clooney resigns from United Nations peacekeeping role 	"George Clooney as a ""messenger for peace"" because he no longer has the time for the position. UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Monday that Clooney, who recently got engaged, had decided stop promoting its peacekeeping efforts.

5395	5396	Governments turn to hacking techniques for surveillance of citizens 	"In a luxury Washington, DC, hotel last month, governments from around the world gathered to discuss surveillance technology they would rather you did not know about. The annual Intelligence Support Systems (ISS) World Americas conference is a mecca for representatives from intelligence agencies and law enforcement. But to the media or members of the public, it is strictly off limits. Gone are the days when mere telephone wiretaps satisfied authorities' intelligence needs. Behind the cloak of secrecy at the ISS World conference, tips are shared about the latest advanced ""lawful interception"" methods used to spy on citizens – computer hacking, covert bugging and GPS tracking. Smartphones, email, instant message services and free chat services such as Skype have revolutionised communication. This has been matched by the development of increasingly sophisticated surveillance technology. Among the pioneers is Hampshire-based Gamma International, a core ISS World sponsor. In April, when Egyptian activists raided state security offices in Cairo and found documents revealing Gamma had in 2010 offered Hosni Mubarak's regime spy technology named FinFisher. The ""IT intrusion"" solutions offered by Gamma would have enabled authorities to infect targeted computers with a spyware virus so they could covertly monitor Skype conversations and other communications. The use of such methods is more commonly associated with criminal hacking groups, who have used spyware and trojan viruses to infect computers and steal bank details or passwords. But as the internet has grown, intelligence agencies and law enforcement have adopted similar techniques. ""Traditionally communications flowed through phone companies, but consumers are increasingly using communications that operate outwith their jurisdiction. This changes the way interception is carried out … the current method of choice would seem to be spyware, or trojan horses,"" said Chris Soghoian, a Washington-based surveillance and privacy expert. ""There's now a thriving outsourced surveillance industry and they are there to meet the needs and wants of countries from around the world, including those who are more – and less – respectful to human rights."" In 2009, while a government employee, Soghoian attended ISS World. He made recordings of seminars and later published them online – which led him to be the subject of an investigation and, ultimately, cost him his Federal Trade Commission job. The level of secrecy around the sale of such technology by western companies, he believes, is cause for alarm. ""When there are five or six conferences held in closed locations every year, where telecommunications companies, surveillance companies and government ministers meet in secret to cut deals, buy equipment, and discuss the latest methods to intercept their citizens' communications – that I think meets the level of concern,"" he said. ""They say that they are doing it with the best of intentions. And they say that they are doing it in a way that they have checks and balances and controls to make sure that these technologies are not being abused. But decades of history show that surveillance powers are abused – usually for political purposes."" Another company that annually attends ISS World is Italian surveillance developer Hacking Team. A small, 35-employee software house based in Milan, Team's technology – which costs more than £500,000 for a ""medium-sized installation"" – gives authorities the ability to break into computers or smartphones, allowing targeted systems to be remotely controlled. It can secretly enable the microphone on a targeted computer and even take clandestine snapshots using its webcam, sending the pictures and audio along with any other information – such as emails, passwords and documents – back to the authorities for inspection. The smartphone version of the software has the ability to track a person's movements via GPS as well as perform a function described as ""remote audio spy"", effectively turning the phone into a bug without its user's knowledge. The venture capital-backed company boasts that its technology can be used ""country-wide"" to monitor more than 100,000 targets simultaneously, and cannot be detected by anti-virus software. ""Information such as address books or SMS messages or images or documents might never leave the device. Such data might never be sent to the network. The only way to get it is to hack the terminal device, take control of it and finally access to the relevant data,"" says David Vincenzetti, founding partner of Hacking Team, who adds that the company has sold its software in 30 countries across five continents. ""Our investors have set up a legal committee whose goal is to promptly and continuously advise us on the status of each country we are talking to. The committee takes into account UN resolutions, international treaties, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International recommendations."" Three weeks ago used by German police forces similar to that offered by Hacking Team. The ""Bundestrojaner [federal trojan]"" software, which state officials confirmed had been used, gave law enforcement the power to gain complete control over an infected computer. The revelation prompted an outcry in Germany, as the use of such methods is strictly regulated under the country's constitutional law. (A court ruling in 2008 established a ""basic right to the confidentiality and integrity of information-technological systems"".) ""Lots of what intelligence agencies have been doing in the last few years is basically computer infiltration, getting data from computers and installing trojans on other people's computers,"" said Frank Rieger, a CCC spokesman. ""It has become part of the game, and what we see now is a diffusion of intelligence methods into normal police work. We're seeing the same mindset creeping in. They're using the same surreptitious methods to gain knowledge without remembering that they are the police and they need to follow due process."" In the UK there is legislation governing the use of all intrusive surveillance. Covert intelligence-gathering by law enforcement or government agencies is regulated under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (Ripa), which states that to intercept communications a warrant must be authorised by the home secretary and be deemed necessary and proportionate in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic wellbeing of the country. There were 1,682 interception warrants approved by the home secretary in 2010, latest official figures show. According to Jonathan Krause, an IT security expert who previously worked for Scotland Yard's hi-tech crime unit, bugging computers is becoming an increasingly important methodology for UK law enforcement. ""There are trojans that will be customer written to get past usual security, firewalls, malware scanning and anti-virus devices, but these sorts of things will only be aimed at serious criminals,"" he said. Concerns remain, however, that despite export control regulations, western companies have been supplying high-tech surveillance software to countries where there is little or no legislation governing its use. In 2009, for instance, it was , after . The technology, if left undetected, would have enabled authorities to bypass BlackBerry email encryption by mining communications from devices before they were sent. Computer security researcher Jacob Appelbaum is well aware what it is like to be a target of covert surveillance. He is a core member of the , which develops free internet anonymising software used by activists and government dissidents across the Middle East and north Africa to evade government monitoring. A former spokesman for WikiLeaks, as part of an ongoing grand jury investigation into the whistleblower organisation. On 13 October he was in attendance at ISS World where he was hoping to arrange a presentation about Tor – only to be ejected after one of the surveillance companies complained about his presence. ""There's something to be said about how these guys are not interested in regulating themselves and they're interested in keeping people in the dark about what they're doing,"" he says. ""These people are not unlike mercenaries. The companies don't care about anything, except what the law says. In this case, if the law's ambiguous, they'll do whatever the law doesn't explicitly deny. It's all about money for them, and they don't care. ""This tactical exploitation stuff, where they're breaking into people's computers, bugging them … they make these arguments that it's good, that it saves lives,"" he said. ""But we have examples that show this is not true. I was just in a couple of days ago and I met people who told me that posting on Facebook resulted in death squads showing up in your house."" The growth in the use of these methods across the world, Appelbaum believes, means governments now have a vested interest in keeping computer users' security open to vulnerabilities. ""Intelligence [agencies] want to keep computers weak as it makes it easier to surveil you,"" he says, adding that an increase in demand for such technology among law enforcement agencies is of equal concern. ""I don't actually think breaking into the computer of a terrorist is the world's worst idea – it might in fact be the only option – but these guys [surveillance technology companies] are trying to sell to any police officer,"" he says. ""I mean, what business does the Baltimore local police have doing tactical exploitation into people's computers? They have no business doing that. They could just go to the house, serve a warrant, and take the computer. This is a kind of state terror that is simply unacceptable in my opinion."" Jerry Lucas, the president of the company behind ISS World, , does not deny surveillance developers that attend his conference supply to repressive regimes. In fact, he is adamant that the manufacturers of surveillance technology, such as Gamma International, SS8 and Hacking Team, should be allowed to sell to whoever they want. ""The surveillance that we display in our conferences, and discuss how to use, is available to any country in the world,"" he said. ""Do some countries use this technology to suppress political statements? Yes, I would say that's probably fair to say. But who are the vendors to say that the technology is not being used for good as well as for what you would consider not so good?"" Would he be comfortable in the knowledge that regimes in Zimbabwe and North Korea were purchasing this technology from western companies? ""That's just not my job to determine who's a bad country and who's a good country. That's not our business, we're not politicians … we're a for-profit company. Our business is bringing governments together who want to buy this technology."" TeleStrategies organises a number of conferences around the world, including in Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific. Every country has a need for the latest covert IT intrusion technology, according to Lucas, because modern criminal investigations cannot be conducted without it. He claimed ""99.9% good comes from the industry"" and accused the media of not covering surveillance-related issues objectively. ""I mean, you can sell cars to Libyan rebels, and those cars and trucks are used as weapons. So should General Motors and Nissan wonder, 'how is this truck going to be used?' Why don't you go after the auto makers?"" he said. ""It's an open market. You cannot stop the flow of surveillance equipment."""	Technology
534	535	Benetton agrees to contribute to Rana Plaza compensation fund 	Benetton has agreed to contribute to a compensation fund for victims of the Rana Plaza factory collapse in nearly two years after the disaster in which 1,100 people died. The move by the Italian fashion brand comes after more than 1 million people in less than a fortnight calling on it to pay up. Benetton said it was working with an “independent, globally recognised third party” to “define the principles of our fair and equitable share of compensation” to the fund, which is backed by the UN’s International Labour Organisation. It is the last of the major retailers who sourced from the eight-floor building to back the fund. Dalia Hashad, Avaaz campaign director, said: “This is a victory for everyone around the world who wants to ensure our clothing never again costs lives. We’re hopeful Benetton will make a significant contribution so the families of workers aren’t left high and dry.” Benetton has promised to confirm the amount it will pay before the second anniversary of the disaster on 24 April. Campaigners are hoping the brand will make up the that would fully compensate victims and their families. So far 5,000 people – injured workers and families of the deceased – have received only 40% of the money due to them and there is only enough in the pot to ensure they get 70%. More than 3,000 people making clothes for western brands including Primark, Walmart and Matalan were injured or killed in the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory building in Bangladesh’s capital, Dhaka. The incident highlighted the plight of millions of low-paid workers making clothes around the world and kicked off to improve conditions in Bangladesh. Despite pressure from campaigners and , Benetton has, until now, held back from contributing to the ILO-backed scheme. The company backed a separate victim support scheme led by Brac, a Bangladeshi development organisation. But pressure groups, such as the Clean Clothes Campaign and Labour Behind the Label, have said the Brac scheme does not amount to proper compensation. Benetton said the ILO-backed scheme had been slow to get off the ground and “lacked clarity” about how money would be allotted. “At the time we had no other option but to launch our own support programme in partnership with Brac,” a spokesperson said. “We did this immediately, starting already only one month after the tragic events and we have since supported 280 victims and family members, to ensure that they had the means, including financial, to rebuild a sustainable future. Step two will be a further contribution in support of the victims, this time through the Rana Plaza trust fund.” Campaigners have also called on retailers that have made only small donations, such as US chain , as well as the Bangladeshi Prime Minister’s Relief Fund, to contribute more. The , which has paid a total of $12m in support for victims, $8m of which counted as part of the ILO-backed scheme. It began making payments directly to workers more than a year ago.	Business
2151	2152	Transcript of the Guardian interview with Mike Leigh at BFI Southbank, London 	"Mike, a lot of the reviews for Happy-Go-Lucky have been in the ""Mike Leigh in cheery film shock"" sort of vein. Has that surprised you? Well, there was a review in London Lite which said, ""Can this be true, has made a comedy?"" Does it surprise me? No, not at all. It doesn't surprise me the rubbish that journalists talk. In this particular case - and this particular journalist otherwise gave it a wonderful review, I have to say - you tend to think that she's either got amnesia or she's very young, if she only knows about Vera Drake, and even that's got it's humour. I don't know, and I don't want to talk about this because it's so irrelevant. But before we talk about the film properly, I thought there's a real brightness to this film, isn't there? It's all splashes of colour in the set design, costumes and the film you used. Tell me a little bit about that. At the point where I got a sense of what the film should be, and I was able to share that, principally with Dick Pope - the cinematographer, who's a genius and who's shot all my films since Life is Sweet in 1990 - and also the production designer, costume designer and makeup designer, I talked about Poppy. I said that this is going to be a vivacious, positive, intelligent, bright woman with a great sense of humour and buzzing with energy, and the film really needs to take its cue from that - the film should burst with energy and colour. At this point, we decided to shoot this film in widescreen - it's the first film I've made that's been widescreen. And we set about shooting tests, just to work out what stocks to use, how to treat them, how to find the palette and things. Curiously, at that precise moment - that week in fact, Fuji announced this new film stock called Vivid, which we used. And it's an absolute delight. So we have this wonderful, rich, succulent colour experience. When you think about the genesis of the film, was it the character of Poppy that first came about or the idea of doing something that was positive, or doing something that was anti-miserable? All of those things, in a way. The making of my films is a journey of discovery - I discover what the film is, really. But obviously, one always has a conception, an idea. In this case, I would more accurately say that I had a feeling. And if you ask what that feeling was, I'd say on the whole it's the feeling that you've got now having seen the film. As it evolved and I started to focus on what I was up to, it began to be clear that the film wanted to be positive, to be anti-miserablist. And I felt that was the right thing to do. Not least because it's about a teacher, it's about somebody who cares and who nurtures the future. We are screwing up the world, and while that's going on we can feel very depressed about that. But actually, people get on with it, and that's what the film's about. But I also wanted to make a film where we could just enjoy ourselves. [Chuckles] I was listening to Salman Rushdie on Sunday evening and he was making a complaint that everyone these days reads everything as autobiographical. With this film, is it autobiographical, is that how you're feeling or were feeling at the time? Or is it just the character? It's very hard to say that there's anything autobiographical in any concrete or literal sense. Some people have suggested that I'm a Scott character. [Laughter from the audience] But I think that you could put that under the general heading of ""Hyperbole"". And apart from anything else, Scott's main characteristic is that he's totally devoid of a sense of humour, which I don't think is something you can accuse me of. But I guess everything's autobiographical - you make a piece of work about people and life and the way we live, and you draw from all kinds of stuff, consciously and subconsciously. I thought the film was quite radical in a way - I mean, the prevailing ideology at the moment is cynicism. It's much more fashionable to be cynical and negative, whether it's about politicians and public institutions, even about teachers. So to make something that's not cynical and about somebody who approaches the world with an open heart - that's really not in the grain of the culture of the moment. I can't add to that. I feel that, and I think that's what we've done in making the film. Here's a clip from Life is Sweet, with Claire Skinner and Jane Horrocks discussing boys and feminism. [Runs clip] I thought it would be interesting to show that, as an example of the humour and wit of your films, and also to demonstrate your impressive record in working with actors, many of whom you work with again and again. What do you look for? Claire Skinner, her contribution to Naked, which was the next film we made after Life is Sweet, is one of my favourite characters in all of my films - Sandra, the nurse, who shows up at the end and who has this wonderful, disjointed way of not completing her sentences. She shows up from her failed safari holiday in Zimbabwe in 1992. And it's a great comic performance. Sally Hawkins, this is the third film that you've worked with her? Yes, Sally was in All or Nothing and Vera Drake, where she's the posh girl who gets a private abortion after being raped. What did you see in her that made you want to make her the focus of this film? Well, she's brilliant - she's extremely versatile, intelligent and hardworking, and she's got a great sense of humour. You've seen her in all kinds of films apart from mine. She's a great actor when working with other people, very generous. She's full of beans. And I just thought it would be great to tap into her energy and special skills. I found Poppy slightly annoying at the beginning - sort of unnecessarily and overly perky. Even when her bike gets stolen that doesn't faze her. Why is that ""unnecessarily, overly perky""? She's cool, philosophical. The bike gets nicked, but what else can you do about it, life goes on. So defend your statement. [Audience laughs] Initially, I thought she came across as a bit one-note - as in she's perky and nothing fazes her. But over the course of the film, she does become more complicated and reveals different levels. As far as I'm concerned, you could be forgiven, especially with the scene where they've gone clubbing and they're being silly having had a few drinks, you could be forgiven for thinking at that point, ""Can I actually spend a couple of hours with this person?"" You almost agree with me then? I am agreeing, but I'm saying that it's pretty much straight away that you start to get the hang of what she's actually about, and I don't think there's any real reason to go on thinking that [she's one-note]. When she gets into the car with Scott - I mean, he's so ludicrous that she just deals with it, her sense of humour takes over. He's a fascinating character - he comes across as somebody who's just a joke but ends up like the love-child of Richard Littlejohn and Melanie Phillips. I don't know them. Probably better off that way. How did you arrive at his backstory? I can't really answer that. We invented him, just like we invented all the other characters and we created his world. I think the important thing to remember is that what we don't do is to say, ""Let's do a baddie, or let's do a guy who's a monster."" Because in some ways, he is a monster, but he's a real person. So what we do is, without attitude or prejudice, we invent somebody with this complete background who has not had a good time in his life, not been treated well and has all these terrible paranoid hang-ups, many of which have grown into really negative and destructive views. But you still have empathy for him. Yes, and you know he's fallen in love and he can't handle it. It reminds me of All or Nothing and one of the characters - Jason, when he goes completely crazy when his girlfriend gets pregnant. You know he's acting totally vile but at the same time you do get some sense of empathy as to why he's behaving the way he is. Yes. I read somewhere that you said that making cheery films cost more money, costume-wise, etcetera ... I never said that - that would be a ridiculous thing to say. I mean you said that for All or Nothing, you said that you could buy all the clothes in charity shops. Well, that's true, that the costume budget for All or Nothing for that reason was very low. I suppose if you follow that logic through, but I think we should talk about something more profound in the National Film Theatre. I can do profundity. Recurring themes in your films - kids, not having kids, etc - do you know they're coming up when you watch the films, or is it a conscious act that they come into your films again? Do you mean when I watch it or when I make it? I mean at the end, when you're watching it, do you think, ""Oh, I didn't realise that that theme is in this as well."" For example, in Happy-Go-Lucky, the desire to have children is in this as well, isn't it? Well, I'm around while these films are being made. [Audience laughs] And I'm quite closely involved in the form and content of them, so I don't have those revelations when I watch them. But you can watch something and see something new for the first time at the end, can't you? Yes, but not main thematic things like that. I'm sorry, I'm not being difficult, but that's an honest answer to your question. Ok, that was a bad question. How much does commercial success matter at this point in your career? You've now got a body of work that speaks for itself, so does it matter as much as it might have done in the past? That's always mattered. First of all, we make these films to be seen. There's no virtue in a film that nobody or very few people see. But unconventional my films may seem to be, they're perfectly conventional in the sense that they are films, they're movies. They're not alternative films that we shoot for no money at all with a little camera. They're proper movies and they have to be funded, and although the budgets are tight, the money has to come from people who back films. And if you've made films that are not commercially successful, people don't want to know. Not least film-makers such as myself, someone who doesn't have a script, who can't tell the backer what it's going to be about and who will not enter into any discussion about having Hollywood stars involved. It helps protect risk in some way. The main thing is, we're not Trappist monks up mountains. We're in the movie business, we want people to see the films. And also, if there's any money made, it simply goes back into things. My most successful film commercially was Secrets and Lies, partly because it got the Palme d'Or at Cannes, partly because it was nominated for five Oscars. But as much as anything, it was because at the time of its release, and it remains illegal today in many countries, including all of South America and many of the Catholic countries in Europe as well as almost all the states in the USA, to trace your birth mother, which is what the film is about. So there was enormous interest in the film. And because the film was, relatively speaking, commercially successful, it enabled us to raise rather more money than we normally did to make Topsy-Turvy. So the short answer to your question is very important indeed. So has the success of Vera Drake helped in putting Happy-Go-Lucky in more screens, for example in multiplexes? Vera Drake was successful critically. It was reasonably successful commercially, but sadly not as successful as we would have liked. And therefore, it really didn't have that cachet. If your films about the business of getting people to see them, have you ever been recently tempted to make things for the BBC or Channel 4, where you'll get a couple of million people watching them? Well, a number of my films, including this one, are backed by Film4, which is effectively television money, and they will, as part of their journey, get seen on one of the Channel 4 channels. So in that sense, that already happens anyway. So, as you know, recently on Film4, you had Vera Drake and Naked. So far as actually making television drama is concerned, I did it with great enthusiasm, between the 1970s and the early 80s, at a time when you couldn't make indigenous serious feature films. That couldn't happen until Channel 4 came along, which changed the landscape, as we all know. But the truth is, that my passion is movies, is film, is cinema, is the big screen. It's partly working to the highest quality that's possible - that's what films are about. It's partly just the experience that you've all had this evening. But it's also the international currency - it's wonderful to make a film that participates in this world language, this universal sharing of movies. And for me, that's as central to the whole thing as anything else. Television drama, which is absolutely important and seen by a lot of people at once, is great. But my own feeling at this stage in the game is that I've sort of done that and I don't really want to do that because of my passion and commitment to cinema and international cinema. Let's open this up to the audience now. "	Film

12063	12064	Galatasaray's Fatih Terim accusses referee of 'lacking courage' after Real Madrid defeat 	"Galatasaray's coach Fatih Terim has accused referee Svein Oddvar Moen of ""lacking courage"" and making ""many mistakes"" after at the Santiago Bernabéu. Terim insisted ""I never comment on referees"" but the problem is that the phrase ""I never comment on referees"" is invariably followed by a ""but"", and so it proved. Galatasary had claimed two penalties, one in each half. The first appeal came after a possible handball by Sami Khedira when the ball hit him from a Wesley Sneijder header, while the second was for a challenge from Sergio Ramos on Burak Yilmaz. Although Ramos appeared to get a touch of the ball first, he trod on Yilmaz's foot. Rather than award a penalty, the referee booked the Galatasary striker and top scorer for diving, ruling him out of the second leg in a week's time. Terim, who began his press conference by congratulating , admitted that his side had made ""basic mistakes"" on the first two goals and that there had been clear chances for Emmanuel Eboué and Didier Drogba which he would have expected them to take. He also insisted that there is a ""big difference in quality between the players on the two teams"" and that the difference had shown. But asked about the possible penalties, he was critical of the official. ""I would not like to talk about the penalties because I never comment on referees, but maybe Real Madrid's big name affected him,"" Terim said. ""The referee did not have courage. Burak's foot was stepped on and everyone saw it except for the referee. I think the referee made many mistakes."" Terim's mention of ""many mistakes"" hinted at a number of other decisions that the Turkish side felt had gone Madrid's way. Although most of them were barely perceptible, replays suggest that Karim Benzema was fractionally offside when Michael Essien delivered the cross from which he scored the second, the free-kick that led to the third was questionable and Benzema was not penalised for a challenge that has been compared to the one that saw Nani get sent off against Madrid at Old Trafford in the last round. When Madrid did get cards, it suited them. and arrive clear of cards for the semi-final. José Mourinho, though, avoided the question of whether they were deliberate by claiming that, in fact, the cards had damaged his plans for the second leg."	Football
3697	3698	Twitter claims $13.6bn market valuation as tech rivals take aim 	", after canvassing professional investors for a week on how much they would be willing to pay for its shares, raised the asking price of its stock by 25% on Monday. The company said it would value its IPO at between $23 and $25 a share, up from the $17 to $20 range, indicating that it was a popular potential investment. Traditionally, however, the banks advising companies on their public debuts start out with a modest asking price, in the hopes that investors will prove willing to pay more.  Twitter also stopped selling its shares a day early, according to a news report by Reuters. It's common for companies to keep order books open for investors until the day before the IPO, but Twitter plans to close the books on Tuesday at noon, Reuters said. In the traditional signals of Wall Street, that move could be interpreted in two ways: it could indicate either high demand for the shares or that investors are tapped out.  Twitter, which plans to list its shares for the first time on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, can now claim a market value of $13.6bn before its shares have even started trading. The company could raise as much as $1.4bn in the offering.  MKM Partners, a research firm for professional investors, said Twitter will be in the competitive ""elite"" of tech companies by its market value.  ""We look at a [comparison] group including Facebook, LinkedIn, TripAdvisor, Yelp and Zillow,"" MKM analyst Rob Sanderson wrote in a client note late last week. ""These companies are regarded as 'category killers', each with very strong operating momentum, disruptive characteristics and open-ended opportunities."" That doesn't necessarily mean smooth sailing ahead, however. Twitter is facing business challenges from rivals as well as skepticism from investors burned by the Facebook IPO.  Twitter is not seen as a good investment by nearly half of active investors, according to . ""That sentiment is stronger from higher-income respondents; some 56% of those with incomes of $75,000 a year have doubts about its investment prospects,"" . In addition, as Twitter's profile rises, rivals are taking aim at its business prospects. ""We presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow,"" the company said.  Twitter revealed on Monday, for instance, that . The patents involve the presentation of advertising and the process of searching for user contacts.  By striking at Twitter's advertising plans, IBM is striking at the company's heart. Twitter gained 85% of its revenue from advertising in 2012, and an even higher percentage – 89% – in the first nine months of this year. ""We generate substantially all of our advertising revenue through the sale of our three promoted products: promoted Tweets, promoted accounts and promoted trends."" Twitter said IBM was not suing, however, and only inviting a negotiation. In its public filing, Twitter said ""we believe we have meritorious defenses,"" although it also said ""there can be no assurance that we will be successful"" in resolving the dispute."	Technology
3372	3373	George Osborne will give you a pay rise. But he won’t let you fight for one 	he backlash has begun. CBI director general John Cridland last week joined the bosses of Next, Whitbread and Wetherspoons in expressing concern about the impact of George Osborne’s “national living wage”, which . It is a gamble. Churlish Corbynites might complain that the £9 or so which over-25s will have to be paid by 2020 is still well below any realistic estimate of the income required to cover basic needs – rent, food, bills and so on. But any shift in the labour market that affects up to six million workers – as this will, once its knock-on effects up the pay scale are taken into account – is radical. In some labour-intensive sectors, including hospitality and retail, which have so far been squealing the loudest, it will create a non-trivial increase in the wage bill, the costs of which will have to be met from somewhere. Whitbread warned that it may have to push up prices in response to the policy; Cridland even said some chief executives he had spoken to were having to rethink their business model. That shouldn’t be surprising. As the , the increased minimum wage isn’t money for nothing: it will have to be paid for, whether through reduced dividends, a few pence on the price of a skinny latte, or a slightly slower pace of job creation. Most likely a bit of everything. Academic research on the impact of recent chunky , including San Francisco and Santa Fe, revealed just such an effect. There were modest job losses, and small price increases in consumer-facing businesses such as restaurants, particularly where local customers were rich enough to afford it. There was a reduction in staff turnover, which could meet up to 20% of the costs of the pay rises through savings on recruitment costs. Without the right to strike, few of the past century’s seminal advances in pay and conditions would have been won That echoes the experience of UK firms that have adopted the Living Wage campaign: they often say a better wage boosts loyalty and productivity. There can be wider economic benefits too: low-income workers tend to spend every penny they earn, and Arin Dube of the University of Massachusetts Amherst has found that higher minimum wages tend to lead to higher consumption, so the benefits ripple out through the local economy. So don’t expect Osborne to crumble in the face of the chorus of back-to-school whinging from Britain’s boardrooms. Cosiness with business is one of the Tories’ weak points with the voters, and standing firm against stingy bosses will boost the chancellor’s campaign to reposition the Tory party as the friend of the worker – and outflank his arch leadership rival Boris Johnson, longtime supporter of the London Living Wage, in the process. In fact, forcing a rethink on business practices was an avowed part of the chancellor’s motivation for adopting the policy (aside from outmanoeuvring the punch-drunk Labour party). One explanation advanced for the “productivity puzzle” at the heart of Britain’s lacklustre recovery is that hiring new people or holding on to old employees has been so cheap that as the good times have returned, it has been easier for firms to boost output by increasing manpower, rather than by investing in innovation and training and working more smartly with the staff they have. Along with the new Apprenticeship Levy, also announced in the budget, which will force large firms to pay into a fund that they can then draw on to pay for staff training, the increase in the minimum wage is intended to make employers think harder about how to get more out of their workforce. But as the chancellor burnishes his credentials as the friend of downtrodden burger-flippers and pint-pullers, it’s worth remembering how we got here. This “government-mandated pay rise”, as Cridland provocatively calls it, is ultimately the result of a labour market in which workers, particularly at the bottom end of the pay scale, have been progressively stripped of their bargaining power: by the Conservative governments of the 1980s; by the cold winds of globalisation; and by the hangover from the deepest recession in living memory. And as Osborne proudly displays his generosity, the Conservatives are preparing to strip employees of the last tattered remnants of their right to strike: a weapon without which few of the past century’s seminal advances in pay and conditions would have been won. If the trade union bill, which will receive its second reading on Monday, becomes law, unions will not only have to meet higher voting thresholds to justify strike action, they will also face a raft of absurdly intrusive constraints. Want to hold a rally to support your cause? You’ll have to publish details of where it will be, how many people will be involved, whether there will be loudspeakers, props or banners, whether you’ll be using social media and what you’re going to say on it. Vince Cable, who witnessed the Conservatives’ modus operandi at close hand during the coalition years, . It is also the precise opposite of the noisy, bottom-up, campaigning approach that was the most inspiring element of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership campaign. So don’t be fooled by Osborne’s pose as the workers’ friend. He should be praised for taking the courageous gamble of raising the minimum wage – but woe betide any worker who wants to take the fight for fair pay into their own hands.	Politics
5753	5754	Harrison Ford: does Star Wars need a septuagenarian Han Solo? 	"So Harrison Ford is still not quite sure whether he wants to spark up the Millennium Falcon's hyperdrive one last time and head back into the Star Wars universe. During an appearance on , to air on Friday, Ford knocked back assumptions that he is dead set to play Han Solo once again in . ""I've not quite made the choice,"" as saying. Of course, we don't know the context for Ford's comments. The wily old tease may have been mugging for the studio audience, lapping up the howls of disappointment that no doubt followed such a statement. But the 71-year-old action movie star said he would play Indiana Jones once again ""in a New York minute"". ""I don't think there is any barrier to Indiana Jones being an old fart,"" he said. ""I'm old enough that we don't need [Sean] Connery anymore – I'm old enough to play my own father."" Ford, who is currently promoting his role in the sci-fi movie , is also taking a role in the latest film in Sylvester Stallone's . All of which begs the question: what is so wrong with Star Wars? A septuagenarian Solo might not be quite as quick with a blaster these days, but the reaction to rumours of Ford's potential involvement in the new Disney take on the long-running space opera has been universally positive. With Abrams having revived Star Trek's fortunes on the big screen (unless one asks hardcore Trekkies), most filmgoers are keenly anticipating a triptych of movies that could consign George Lucas's hapless prequel trilogy to a dustbin filled with the rotting remains of Jar Jar Binks and that guy with the from Yoda's Jedi council. Not Ford, though. Despite its launching him to fame and fortune, he of the series' magnificence. Let's look at some of the comments attributed to the actor over the decades. While promoting 1983's Return of the Jedi, Ford told an interviewer: ""Three is enough for me. I was glad to see that costume for the last time."" In 2010, he described the character as ""not so interesting to me"", adding: ""I thought he should have died in the last one, just to give it some bottom."" There is, of course, , attributed to Ford while shooting the original films and aimed at Lucas: ""George, you can type this shit, but you sure can't say it."" (He may have had a point.) Ford has been absent from in recent years, so it's clear that something is up. Over the decades, commentators have suggested the actor favours Indiana Jones because Han Solo is ostensibly a supporting character, and because Ford's career as a leading man did not really take off until , in 1981. Here's the thing: audiences may want more Han Solo, but I don't know many people who really want to see Ford strap on the whip and fedora once again for another outing as everybody's favourite decrepit, swashbuckling archeology professor. At least, not after the mess Lucas and Steven Spielberg made of the CGI-ruined . Abrams has the film-making guile to successfully resurrect favourite characters without letting them overwhelm the action, as he proved with Leonard Nimoy's wise and statesmanlike return as Spock Prime in . Ford might not be as front and centre in Episode VII as he might be in another Indiana Jones film, but his role would be more meaningful than a glorified cameo. And critical commentary would not necessarily focus on his ability (or lack of) to perform acts of physical dexterity. It is, presumably, easier for a gentleman of advanced years to pilot a technologically advanced space freighter through an asteroid field than it might be for him to outpace giant rolling boulders and leap desperately out of the way of booby-trapped spears. With luck, Ford is just joshing us, playing up the grumpy old space git persona he's carefully moulded for more than three decades. Waiting for the world to cheer him back into the hot seat. But there was little sign of the moody Ford when discussing Ender's Game this week. On Tuesday, he gushed over the movie's source novel by the as a ""very impressive act of imagination"". Here again, Ford is in a supporting role, but . Not so with Star Wars. Come on, Harrison: give the people what they want for once. There are myriad characters best forgotten, but Han Solo is not one of them. Besides, we're betting you can still do the Kessel run in 12 parsecs if you put your mind to it."	Film
4519	4520	'Racist abuse' of Yaya Touré has already been dismissed by CSKA Moscow 	"t should be no surprise that CSKA Moscow have denied any possibility that Yaya Touré could have been racially abused during their Champions League meeting with at the Khimki Arena on Wednesday evening. Every time there is an apparently racist incident in Russian football the denials and implausible explanations follow swiftly. That many Russian football clubs have a problem with racist fans is no secret to black players who have played in the country's league and frequently suffered abuse, but officials are often eager to dismiss the problem as fabricated by nefarious overseas media. Although the majority of racist incidents do involve isolated groups of fans rather than whole stands, there is a distinct lack of will on behalf of Russian clubs and officials to take the issue seriously, according to many black players. Particularly troubling is the continued taunting of them with monkey noises and bananas, things which have been repeatedly written off as not racist. Exactly what happened at the City match this week is still unclear, with CSKA absolutely adamant that nothing of the sort happened. The club even released a statement from Touré's fellow Ivorian Seydou Doumbia, who plays for the Moscow side and said he had heard no racist chants and that his countryman was ""clearly exaggerating"". Doumbia was himself the victim of an apparent racist incident in 2011, when a Zenit St Petersburg fan threw an orange at him after he scored. Several fans who attended the Manchester City game and sat in different parts of the ground confirmed to the Guardian that they had not seen or heard any racist abuse. ""The crowd were very well-behaved and despite the loss, fans were calm, there was no violence or vandalism, and nor is there any video evidence of racist chants on YouTube,"" said Dmitry Medvedenko, a Russian journalist and CSKA fan who was at the game. ""There have been cases like that before in Russia, that is true and it's a disgrace for Russian football, but most fans are appalled by such behaviour."" But even at the top level of the Russian government, there has been little acknowledgement that racism among the country's fans could be a problem. During a Euro 2012 game between Russia and the Czech Republic in the Polish city of Wroclaw, Russian fans were accused of racially abusing the black Czech defender Theodor Gebre Selassie with insults and monkey chants. At the time the sports minister Vitaly Mutko branded those allegations ""stupid and untrue"". He said that the fans had in fact been complaining that Czech fans were not taking part in a Mexican wave that the Russians had attempted to get going. In the league, there have also been a number of incidents with apparent racist overtones that have been dismissed as ""misunderstandings"". With Russia due to host the 2018 World Cup, there are worries among black players about the reception they might receive during the tournament. African students in the Russian capital live in fear of physical attacks, and racist chanting is often seen as acceptable ""banter"" by fans. The former Brazil full-back Roberto Carlos, who spent the final seasons of his career playing for Anzhi Makhachkala, had separate incidents with fans taunting him with bananas during games at Zenit St Petersburg and Krylya Sovetov. On the second occasion, Roberto Carlos left the pitch in disgust before the end of the match. He later said he had been close to tears in the dressing room after the game and had even considered retiring from football over the incident. An official investigation found that the Zenit fan who appeared to offer Roberto Carlos a banana had actually ""been eating a banana and was then pushed in the back, forcing him to move the banana in front of him to avoid damaging it"". The fan was not punished, although the Russian league fined Zenit £6,000. In the second incident the Krylya Sovetov fan who threw the banana was identified using video footage, but also denied any racial intent, saying merely that he had thrown a banana out of anger at the fact his team were losing 3-0, and ""the banana landed close to Roberto Carlos by chance"". The club did not fine the fan. The Nigeria and former Spartak Moscow striker Emmanuel Emenike was fined around £10,000 by the Russian FA when he made obscene gestures at Dynamo Moscow fans who were racially abusing him last year. The FA did not fine the club for the racist chants. Another Moscow club, Lokomotiv, gained notoriety when its fans displayed a huge banner in English that read ""Thanks West Brom"" alongside a picture of a half-peeled banana, when the Nigeria winger Peter Odemwingie signed a deal with the English side. ""Supporters of all teams regularly do this kind of thing,"" said Ivan Kalashnikov, deputy editor of the sports.ru website. ""In the Russian league, people just close their eyes to it."""	Football
8927	8928	Margaret Thatcher funeral: more than 4,000 police to be deployed 	"Scotland Yard says more than 4,000 officers will be deployed for Wednesday's funeral of Lady Thatcher as British counter-terrorism officials assess if the Boston Marathon bombing has implications for the security of the high-profile event. The number of officers means central London will in effect be on lockdown for the funeral, with a police officer visible every few yards of the procession route. Hundreds of officers will be kept ""kitted up"" and ready to rush to flashpoints as part of a major security operation. The funeral was always going to see a strong police presence but the attack in Boston has refocused attention on the security aspect of the event, which will be attended by the Queen, prime minister and foreign dignitaries. In a statement, The Metropolitan police's Commander Christine Jones said despite the security concerns, protests against the Thatcher legacy would be allowed. She also said no arrests had been made so far against people suspected by police of wanting to commit crimes at the funeral, but said this tactic remained an option. Critics have branded it as ""pre-emptive arrests"", which threaten the ancient right to protest. Police said a small number of people planning protests had contacted them and they urged those wanting to demonstrate to get in touch. In a statement, Jones said: ""Every operation that we deliver is based upon a thorough assessment of the potential risks and threats, and we plan the most effective ways to mitigate against them. We wish to deliver our operation in a way that protects public safety within the context of a broader security operation – as with many ceremonial London events."" Roads will be closed and sterile areas will be set up where the public cannot enter. Jones said: ""The right to conduct peaceful protest is a tenant [sic] of our democracy, however, that right is qualified in that protest does not stray into acts of crime or violence or the instigation of crime or violence. ""We will continue to review our intelligence and evidence picture, and although to date no arrests connected to the ceremonial funeral have yet been made, should the need arise to arrest those who are committing acts of crime or violence, or conspiring to do so, we will respond accordingly."" As well as any implications from the Boston attack, security officials will take account of a series of challenges ranging from dissident Irish republican terrorists, the threat of al-Qaida-inspired violence, through to activists on the far left who may use the funeral to show their contempt for Thatcher through violence."

6336	6337	Sunderland reject £5m bid for Connor Wickham from West Ham 	West Ham have had a £5m bid for Connor Wickham rejected by but they could yet be willing to sell the England Under-21 striker if an increased offer comes in for him. Gus Poyet, the Sunderland manager, is reluctant to lose Wickham, whose goals helped to keep the Wearsiders in the Premier League last spring, but the 21-year-old only has a year remaining on his current contract and is stalling over a new deal at the Stadium of Light. Sunderland are determined they will not allow him to run his agreement down before leaving on a free transfer next summer. Should West Ham increase their offer to around the £8m mark, and no agreement can be reached over a contract extension, Sunderland could be persuaded to sell the 21-year-old – particularly if Fabio Borini finally agrees to a long mooted £14m move from Liverpool. Sam Allardyce desperately needs a new centre forward to replace Andy Carroll, who again is out with a long-term injury, but could face competition for Wickham from Newcastle, with their manager Alan Pardew an admirer of the player, who joined Sunderland from Ipswich for £8m three years ago. Yet much as Newcastle would like to bring a striker who scored five goals in only 12 Premier League appearances last season to St James’ Park, Sunderland would be extremely reluctant to sell to their local rivals.

2659	2660	Rouble rise prompts hopes that Russian economic crisis is easing 	Hopes rose on Wednesday night that might be over the worst of its currency crisis after higher oil prices and measures to shore up struggling banks prompted a sharp rally in the value of the rouble. Concerted efforts by the Kremlin, the Russian central bank and the finance ministry helped push the currency back to the level at which it started the week, ahead of Thursday’s opportunity for President Vladimir Putin to pronounce on the recent economic and financial turmoil at his annual press conference. Putin said earlier in the month that a falling rouble was good for the Russian economy, but senior policymakers in Moscow showed on Wednesday how seriously they were taking the threat of a rouble freefall. Putin’s prime minister, , sought to assure the country that Russia had the tools to cope with a currency that had fallen below its “comfort” level, while the finance minister said it was buying roubles on the foreign exchanges with $7bn (£4.5bn) of its reserves. Later, the central bank said it would relax accounting standards, allow banks to disguise the true extent of their losses, and allow them to value their assets in the third quarter of 2014, before the currency turmoil began. There are also plans to pump more capital into the banks during 2015. Further respite for the rouble was provided when the cost of crude rose by $3 to $63 a barrel following news of lower inventories in the US. In New York trading, it cost just less than 60 roubles to buy a dollar compared to 80 roubles when the sell-off was at its height on Tuesday. Even so, the rouble has lost around half its value against the dollar since the start of the year and the economic stability that has been the cornerstone of Putin’s promises to the Russian people appears seriously under threat. Analysts say falling oil prices have combined with structural problems and the effect of western sanctions to create a “perfect storm” that has battered the rouble. A hike in interest rates from 10.5% to 17% late on Monday failed to halt the slide, and the central bank has been burning through its foreign currency reserves in at attempt to stem the fall. The central bank has spent more than $80bn in foreign reserves this year propping up the currency. Shops in Moscow are putting up prices rapidly to keep up with the plummeting rouble, and Apple closed its online shop in Russia. There has been a flurry of retail activity as Russians scramble to buy goods imported before the currency crash and still priced at the old rate. Others cancelled foreign holidays, realising how little their roubles were now worth abroad, while those with euro or dollar mortgages and loans are particularly exposed. “In the last couple of days several people have come up to me and asked if I could find them jobs abroad,” said one western banker in Moscow. “And I’m talking about people who even a month ago were very patriotic and supportive of everything going on here.” Kremlin watchers will be looking closely to see if Putin adopts a more conciliatory tone or comes out fighting on Thursdayt. In his state of the nation address earlier in the month, Putin was combative, blaming the west for trying to destroy Russia and justifying the annexation of Crimea as the return of “sacred Russian land”. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the president would not comment on the rouble before his press conference. Earlier this month, he blamed the rouble fall on speculators, whom he said would be identified and punished. Medvedev said at a televised cabinet meeting on Wednesday: “All the economic and production goals that you have set yourselves, the country has the currency resources to achieve them.” He added that the government had no plans to use capital controls. Nicholas Ebisch, currency analyst at Caxton FX, said: “The finance ministry of Russia is now echoing the central bank’s calls that the rouble is undervalued against its major trading partners. This move is the next phase of attempts to strengthen the currency to stop the rouble’s slide, which has alleviated the rouble for the time being, although exchange rates with other currencies remain volatile. “However, this move is akin to putting a plaster on the wall of a dam that is about to burst.” He said the underlying economic strength of Russia’s economy is still in grave doubt as oil prices slide.

14292	14293	Michael Gove urged to investigate Twitter attack on former minister 	" is being urged to launch an inquiry into an ""extraordinary attack"" on the former Tory education minister Tim Loughton on a Twitter feed that is widely believed to be run by close allies of the education secretary. Labour called on Gove to act after , which tweets news about the education secretary, accused Loughton of telling ""lies"" about child protection. In its tweet @toryeducation : "".@timloughton Your lies on this subject are by far the worst of anything you've done in politics & we hope nobody believes a word you say."" Loughton has been in conflict with Gove and his allies since he was sacked as children's minister in the government reshuffle last September. The former minister told the Commons education select committee in January that children's issues were a ""declining priority within the department"". Gove's allies hit back the following day by that Loughton was a ""lazy incompetent narcissist obsessed only with self-promotion"". The row erupted again on Tuesday after Loughton reacted to a government announcement on child abuse in Doncaster by saying that tougher action could have been taken two years ago. In a tweet, after the education department issued a response to a report by Lord Carlile into the Edlington case in Doncaster, Loughton : ""Tougher … should have happened in 2011 when I wanted to publish SCR [serious case review] in full."" Loughton hit back at the accusation that he had lied by claiming that he had originally been in favour of publishing the Edlington serious case review. He : ""@toryeducation time 4 a senior DfE source to come out from cloak of anonymity and face scrutiny rather than rewriting history shamelessly?"" Loughton then added in another tweet: ""@toryeducation now we know there were only 5 people in room privy to me being blocked from publishing SCR so shall I name them?"" This tweet is understood to be highly significant. Gove's allies are maintaining that Loughton was keen to prevent the publication of serious case reviews because he wanted, in the words of an education department source to , to ""maintain a culture of secrecy"". It is believed, however, that Loughton sent a personal memo to Gove a year ago while still a minister expressing unease over the delay in publishing the Edlington serious case review. It is understood that Loughton thought that the serious case review in one other area should not be published for highly sensitive reasons. The existence of a personal memo from Loughton to Gove could prove problematic for the authors of the @toryeducation twitter feed and the education department sources. It appears to contradict directly the key allegations made by the author or authors of the feed. Dominic Cummings and Henry de Zoete, Gove's two special advisers, have denied any involvement on @toryeducation. De Zoete : ""Nope. Don't know who it is."" Cummings told the newspaper: ""Of course I'm not this Twitter account and never have been. I focus on project-managing priorities. I don't waste my time on Twitter and you should tell your staff to do the same."" Ian Mearns, a Labour member of the Commons education select committee, said: ""This extraordinary attack [on Tim Loughton] is another example of derogatory language by the Toryeducation twitter feed. Michael Gove needs to investigate if this feed is run by his advisers – if so that would be very serious. There is no place for these kind of personal attacks in public life. The education secretary needs to take action."""	Politics
11135	11136	Blair says 'Let us reorder this world' 	"In what was almost certainly the most powerful speech of his career, the prime minister used his speech to the to synthesise an uncompromising hostility to Osama bin Laden's terrorist network - and the Taliban if they do not give him up - with a vaunting promise to remake the world as a better place. The sweep and moral fervour of the 54-minute address caught friend and foe off guard. There were no party political jibes and barely a triumphalist mention of Labour's historic June 7 election victory. The Conservatives damned the performance with faint praise. Evidently sensitive to charges that he was sounding too confrontational, Mr Blair acknowledged that many people are fearful of what lies ahead - and sought to reassure voters whose unwavering support is vital to a long campaign. ""Our way of life is a great deal stronger and will last a greal deal longer than the actions of fanatics, small in number and now facing a unified world against them. People should have confidence. This is a battle with only one outcome: our victory, not theirs,"" he insisted. Admitting his own helplessness in the face of so much bereavement on September 11, Mr Blair had earlier said of the dead: ""They don't want revenge, they want something better in memory of their loved ones. I believe their memorial can and should be that out of the shadow of this evil should emerge lasting good."" The speech, which was, unusually, drafted by Mr Blair himself, also reflected his private moral preoccupations to an unusual degree. But before a largely secular audience it was repeatedly punctuated with bursts of applause in the packed but sombre Brighton conference centre, where the foreshortened 2001 conference ends today. As the prime minister sat down he was praised for his vision and tone by friends and critics alike within Labour's ranks, though delegates may come down to earth with a jolt when they size up to the challenges he posed in the name of ""the power of community"" - local and global - to do good. ""He didn't deal with the whats and hows, but he certainly explained the why,"" said one former cabinet member. Some leftwingers and trade unionists, irked by the address's religiosity, called it ""messianic"" and lacking commitment to the means of righting the world's wrongs. They were a minority. ""Brilliant,"" said a senior colleague after hearing his party leader - famous for his regard for business tycoons - declare: ""The starving, the wretched, the dispossessed, the ignorant, they are our cause too."" Throughout the day's debates senior ministers, including Jack Straw, Geoff Hoon and Clare Short, had stressed the importance of adhering to international law in the search for justice - a point echoed by the veteran Tony Benn in an emotional warning against the ""sorrows of war"". An end to famine, poverty and corruption in Africa, as well as genocidal conflicts such as Rwanda's, were only part of an agenda that foresaw the world tackling such intractable problems as global warming and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - an ""equal partnership"" side by side in their own lands. Though the back half of Mr Blair's text addressed the domestic agenda - the need to put improved public services before tax cuts - he repeatedly went out of his way to reconcile Islam with the west, above all with America. For all its flaws the US, where a black child of poverty such as Colin Powell could rise to be secretary of state (""I wonder frankly whether such a thing could have happened here"") was still a model to the world, he argued. Nor had America lashed out, as some had predicted: ""no missiles on the first night just for effect"". When military strikes came they would be ""proportionate, targeted - we will do all we humanly can to avoid civilian casualties"". While the west must address its shameful ignorance of Islam, he later suggested, ""it is time also for parts of Islam to confront prejudice against America"" - not only Islam, but ""parts of western societies too"". That was loudly applauded in a conference where such sentiments have long existed. But Mr Blair's conciliatory and idealistic tone was not extended to the enemy of the moment, whose version of Islam was ""no more obedient to the proper teachings of the Koran"" than the crusaders of the Middle Ages had exemplified the gospel message, he said. ""Be in no doubt Bin Laden and his people organised this atrocity,"" Mr Blair insisted. He offered no evidence, although he did suggest that terrorism finances itself through Afghan heroin sold on the streets of Britain. His contempt for the Taliban and their denial of human rights, especially for women, was stinging. But he did not say, as briefers had indicated overnight, that it was already too late to avoid military retribution. ""I say to the Taliban: surrender the terrorist or surrender power. It's your choice."" Mr Blair's pledge to defeat the ""act of evil"" that destroyed the World Trade Centre - ""if they could have murdered not 7,000 but 70,000 does anyone doubt they would have done so and rejoiced?"" - was only the trailer to a declaration that globalisation made cooperation between nations and cultures imperative. ""This is a moment to seize,"" he said. ""The kaleidoscope has been shaken, the pieces are in flux, soon they will settle again. Before they do let us reorder this world around us and use modern science to provide prosperity for all. ""Science can't make that choice for us, only the moral power of a world acting as a community can."""	Politics
7305	7306	Power plant construction programme 'may prove expensive and unnecessary' 	"Britain risks locking itself into an expensive and unnecessary programme of power plant construction under flawed new policies being pursued by the government, a key committee of MPs has warned. Consumers could be forced to underwrite more than £350m of extra spending in the first year alone if ministers do not put more emphasis on reducing power demand rather than building more capacity, according to the energy and climate change committee. In a letter to energy minister Matthew Hancock the committee chairman, Tim Yeo, also accuses the UK's main energy infrastructure provider, , which is playing a key role in the schemes, of being hopelessly compromised. ""It is impossible for National Grid to give objective advice to government on this issue since the profitability of their regulated United Kingdom business is directly linked to the construction of new transmission capacity,"" he wrote. His committee has been taking evidence in what is called ""electricity demand-side measures"" to review the role being proposed for those who can help reduce the need for power. This is particularly valuable now, when the UK is facing an energy crisis, because old coal and nuclear plants are being retired and new windfarms or gas plants are not being built quickly enough. Yeo told Hancock that demand-side response (DSR) offered a cheap and greener alternative to building new generating capacity. He added that it should play a crucial and growing role in keeping the lights on in coming years. He praised the Department of & Climate Change (DECC), the regulator Ofgem and the National Grid for progressing initiatives but fears unnecessary obstacles are also being thrown in the way of this new industry. ""Many DSR industry representatives have expressed serious and legitimate concerns,"" Yeo said. Among those worries are that DSR providers can only win contracts for one year while power station builders can get deals that run for 15 years. The £359m annual cost of building new power stations as opposed to reducing demand mentioned by Yeo is taken from a new study, also out on Friday, by NERA Economic Consulting, which is working for DSR companies such as KiWi Power. A DECC spokesman said it was too early to comment on the NERA report but defended the role of National Grid and said the infrastructure provider was doing all it could to understand the concerns of the demand reduction providers. ""We are talking to the DSR industry to better understand the issues they face. We want to make sure the market works efficiently and offers consumers the best possible deal,"" he added. In a statement on Thursday night, National Grid also defended its role, saying it ""does not give advice to government on the level of DSR that should be procured in the capacity market auction. We advise on how much capacity is needed in total, but we are neutral how that capacity is made up – whether it comes from generation or demand side response."""	Business
8969	8970	GTA Online 'stimulus package' to drop this week 	"Rockstar is finally preparing to gift $500,000 of virtual cash to every player of its GTA Online mode – a promise the company made on 14 October, but has so far been unable to deliver. informed gamers that another update to the online multiplayer servicer, which is free to owners of Grand Theft Auto 5, will be made available for download early this week. The money will then be dropped into the accounts of players, in two equal payments of $250,000, a few days later. There's a condition, however: the package will only be provided to veterans who played GTA Online during its shaky debut month. Launched on 2 October, the ambitious online option, which allows players to compete for cash and experience points on the streets of Los Santos, has been beset by server breakdowns as well as data loss problems. Thousands complained of losing characters and money as Rockstar engineers fought to cope with the demand of several million players hitting its online infrastructure simultaneously. Several downloadable updates have followed, some to solve technical issues, other to prevent wily players from exploiting glitches in the game to make easy money. The continuing problems with data loss, as well as ongoing attempts to balance the in-game economy, are almost certainly behind the delay in issuing the $500,000 payout. Players have seen several major changes to the financial system over the past few weeks including a large reduction in the cost of being killed in the game's open-world ""free"" mode, but also a reduction in the amount that can be made from repeatedly beating the same money-making missions. Away from money woes, the publisher is promising a range of new content for the GTA Online game mode in order to maintain interest. The free ""Beach Bum"" downloadable content pack, due in ""early November"", adds new beach-themed vehicles and clothes as well as extra races and Gang Attack, Survival and Last Team Standing jobs. A content creator mode is also due, allowing players to create their own customised races and death matches, with the best featured on the Rockstar site. The company has also announced a series of Online Social Club Event weekends, with special bonuses, rewards and limited edition crate drops into the online city. More intriguingly, Rockstar assures us this will be the week we find out about the new Heists, which are set to bring more in-depth cooperative missions to the online offering. A Capture The Flag mode is also imminent. The publisher's mailout ends with yet another seductive promise: ""We will also have initial details on more additional content coming for both Story Mode and GTA Online in the next few weeks."" For now, though, many GTA Online players have just one demand for Rockstar: show me the money."	Technology
12244	12245	Crystal Palace left in limbo as Mackay talks end and Hoddle turns down job 	Crystal Palace’s attempts to secure a successor to Tony Pulis are set to extend beyond Saturday’s derby against West Ham United after the club felt compelled to pull the plug on the anticipated appointment of Malky Mackay. The former Cardiff City manager to be reunited with the Palace sporting director, Iain Moody, at Selhurst Park, the pair having previously worked together at the Welsh club. However, Palace opted to break off negotiations , much to Mackay’s surprise and disappointment, and are now pursuing alternative options. The former England manager Glenn Hoddle, who is currently working part-time as a coach at Queens Park Rangers, has turned down the job. Palace have offered no official reason for severing talks with Mackay at this stage, although it appears to have stemmed from the Scot’s acrimonious , the ramifications of which continue to rumble on. The Championship club have been in communication with the Football Association in recent days, with City understood to have questioned a number of fees paid to agents and lawyers, who they have apparently named, in relation to incoming transfers sanctioned during Mackay and Moody’s time at the Welsh club. The relationship between the Cardiff owner, Vincent Tan, and his former manager and sporting director broke down spectacularly following promotion to the Premier League, with Moody and Mackay dismissed before the mid-point of last season. The pair have consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing during their time with City. The FA is expected to look at the claims, although it would offer no comment on the record. on Wednesday This was followed by allegations that the pair exchanged offensive messages which the governing body is also believed to be looking into. It was perhaps telling that negotiations between Palace and Mackay were broken off on the day Cardiff dispatched legal letters to the south London club and Moody over the “spy-gate” scandal, stemming from the alleged leaking of their starting lineup before the sides’ game on 5 April, informing them they intend to pursue a claim for financial damages of up to £20m in loss of earnings as a result of relegation. It remains to be seen whether Moody’s position can be considered tenable. The Premier League last week found Palace – who won the game 3-0 – , which states clubs must behave towards each other “with the utmost good faith”, after a four-month investigation into City’s claims, and will fine them up to £25,000 for the offence. That has served to fuel the lingering animosity between the clubs and the prospect of a lengthy legal action extending into the season ahead, together with the controversy surrounding Cardiff’s complaint to the FA, appears to have dissuaded Palace from reuniting the pair at Selhurst Park. That decision has left them managerless and with time ticking down to add to their squad, which they concede is currently short of bodies, in this transfer window as they change tack and consider alternative options. The caretaker manager, Keith Millen, will oversee training on Thursday, face the media and select the team for Saturday, with the former first-team coach expected to be in charge against West Ham regardless of whether progress is made on securing an alternative appointment. Hoddle, who emerged late as a contender, is not seeking a return to full-time management, while Tim Sherwood, who had impressed in interviews held on Sunday and Monday, is effectively no longer in contention, given the club’s initial eagerness to appoint Mackay made it clear he was second choice. The former Tottenham Hotspur manager, who had gleaned 42 points from his 22 games in charge last season before being dismissed in May, had been seeking to bring his coaching staff from Spurs, Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey, with him to the south London club and it was unclear whether he would be willing to work with Moody. Alternative options such as Steve Clarke, Neil Lennon and Roberto Di Matteo had been considered, along with the former Palace player Tony Popovic, who is currently coaching Western Sydney Wanderers, although no contact has as yet been instigated by the Palace co-chairman, Steve Parish. The former Fulham manager Martin Jol was sounded out, as was the ex-Manchester United boss David Moyes, although neither was inclined to take on the challenge. Parish is seeking a figure with “an intimate knowledge” of the Premier League, either as a player or a manager, with the club’s pursuit of a successor to Pulis ongoing.	Football
3835	3836	Saido Berahino prepared to leave West Brom to fulfil dream 	Saido Berahino said he may have to leave to achieve his ambitions. The 21-year-old striker, who has been handed his first senior England call-up, would be prepared to move, with Manchester United, Liverpool and Tottenham all linked with him. Berahino, who has a contract until 2017, acknowledged he would leave to progress. “If that’s what it comes to it has to be that,” he said. “I appreciate what West Brom have done for me and I am working hard to bring the club up. I just stay focused and right now I’m focused on West Brom and the games coming up. “My aim would be to play in the Champions League, to be involved in the seniors and play in World Cups and Euros. “I take each game as it comes, work hard and I have a big vision and hopefully I can reach my goals. There will be more eyes on me but I know I can handle the pressure and let the football do the talking. “I’ve had a good start to the season and worked extremely hard and now I have the chance to progress even more. It’s up to me to take it with both hands.” Berahino is the top-scoring Englishman in the Premier League with seven goals and Alan Irvine does not want to lose him. The West Brom head coach said: “We are hoping to take the club forward. We all know there are certain clubs who are competing for Champions League spots year after year and it’s important for any young player who wants to go to those clubs to make sure it’s the right time to go.” Berahino is preparing to face Slovenia in a qualifier and then a friendly with Scotland this month. He was in bed when the news was announced on Thursday and Berahino got the confirmation from his mother, Liliane, who was watching it on television. “I couldn’t believe it. Even driving to the training ground it still all seems like a dream,” Berahino said. “My mum was in the living room and she saw the news on the telly. So I actually heard about it just like everybody else did. “There were rumours flying around that I might be in the squad. When I got into training all the lads shook my hand and told me to make sure I stay focused.”	Football
4636	4637	Ajax Cape Town FC 1-1 Manchester United 	Shinji Kagawa's performance brightened the mood of fans who learned before kick-off that Chris Smalling may miss 10 weeks due to a toe injury and then watched as Bébé's late equaliser saved face against Ajax Cape Town. Ajax's opener came in the 86th-minute when a dawdling United defence allowed Alcardo van Graan to fashion a flicked-heel finish. Moments later, Van Graan missed an open goal before United surged upfield in added time and Bébé, a second-half replacement, finished. Following the news that Smalling's broken metatarsal could rule him out for close to three months, Kagawa stepped out for his first start in United colours to show a touch, vision and creative play when lining up in the hole in a 4-4-1-1 which suggested his £12m fee from Borussia Dortmund could be a shrewd investment. As Ajax have never been champions of South Africa they were not ideal opposition to provide a barometer of the forward's abilities. But the Japanese was United's classiest operator throughout, wandering into space behind Javier Hernández, the main striker, to cause problems and fashion chances for the Mexican. One came a minute after the break when Kagawa dropped into midfield, peered up, then slid the ball on the diagonal into Hernandez's run, though the striker steered the chance wide. The 24-year-old also spurned an earlier opportunity when, from a Scott Wootton cross from the right, Hernandez's header was saved by Sander Westerveld, the former Liverpool goalkeeper. Kagawa missed as good an opportunity on the hour. This time, Hernández did the creating by flipping in a cross from the left and the 22-year-old headed down but wide of the right post. Kagawa's afternoon ended on 77 minutes and there was also a flash of promise from Nick Powell, the £4m buy from Crewe Alexandra. Making his debut as a substitute, the 18-year-old produced a sharp save from the Ajax keeper, Sean Roberts, with a fierce shot.	Football
6814	6815	European markets rally as euro hits 11-year low 	Greek shares led European stock markets higher ahead of Sunday’s elections, while the euro slid to an 11-year low against the dollar, in the wake of the . Stock and bond markets around the world were given a shot in the arm by the ECB’s bigger than expected to fight deflation and revive the ailing eurozone economy. European shares are heading for their best week in three years, as is the FTSE 100 index in London, while emerging markets are on course for their strongest performance in nearly 10 months. The Greek stock market staged a relief rally, jumping 6.6%, led by banks including Attica Bank, National Bank of and Piraeus Bank. There was some optimism that the anti-bailout party Syriza, which is leading in the polls, could reach a compromise with Greece’s lenders if they win the election. Daiwa economist Robert Kuenzel said: “With Greece having most to lose if it left the euro, we suspect Syriza’s bark will be worse than its eventual bite.” Greece will be eligible for the ECB bond-buying programme but subject to stricter conditions because of its bailout from the and the International Monetary Fund. The prospect of QE had already driven the euro lower in past months and the ECB’s move on Thursday triggered fresh declines. The euro fell below 75p for the first time in seven years, dropping to 74.82p, down 1.2%. Against the dollar, it slid over 2% to go below $1.12 for the first time in more than 11 years. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, said: “Clearly there is a much greater chance that the euro hits parity with the US dollar once again, as it first did in 1999.” He explained: “2015 has opened with an astonishing number of event shocks and market volatility. These include further declines in oil prices, surprise rate cuts by various central banks, the lifting of the SNB’s Swiss Franc cap against the euro and the unveiling of the ECB’s substantial QE programme. One consequence has been the speed of the depreciation of the euro.” Carmakers, which rely on exports and benefit from a weaker euro, were among the biggest gainers, with BMW shares up nearly 5% to hit a record high and France’s Peugeot Citroën rising 3.7%. European government bond prices rose, pushing Italian and Spanish 10-year yields to record lows. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares jumped more than 2% to 1483.91, a seven-year high, and is on track for its strongest week since December 2011. Shares also received a fillip from better than expected eurozone data. The composite Markit purchasing manager survey, which covers manufacturers and services firms, bounced to a five-month high of 52.2 from Cember’s 51.4. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: “We are moving away from the lows seen towards the end of last year but the actual rate of growth being signalled is still moderate.” amid uncertainty over whether this could mean a change to the kingdom’s policy of allowing prices to fall. Brent crude gained more than a dollar to $49.70 a barrel. Oil prices pared gains when the new king, , and said Ali al-Naimi would remain the country’s oil minister, a position he has held since 1995. Oil prices have more than halved since the summer, when crude was more than $100 a barrel, amid an oil glut and weak global demand.	Business
10188	10189	Swiss bank’s currency U-turn hurts watchmakers, skiers and traders 	Watch makers, ski resorts and currency traders were facing big losses on Thursday when the Swiss central bank stunned the financial markets by abandoning its currency peg against the euro. Swiss manufacturers faced what one business leader described as a “tsunami” of financial pain as the franc responded to the shock announcement, jumping by an initial 30% against the euro. Movements of around 2% are usually considered big in the foreign exchange markets. The move wiped 9% off the value of the Swiss stock market – its biggest one-day fall in more than 25 years. One trader described the market reaction as “complete carnage”. The Swiss action is the latest event to unsettle markets since the turn of the year and came amid growing concern about the health of the global economy and warnings from the International Monetary Fund that the recovery since the recession of 2008-09 remained weak. Speaking iIn the US, IMF director general Christine Lagarde said global growth was “still too low, too brittle and too lopsided”. There was a risk, she added, of the eurozone and Japan getting stuck in a world of low growth and low inflation for a prolonged period. Strong signs that the (ECB) will announce a large-scale programme of quantitative easing (QE) – electronic money printing – to lift the eurozone out of deflation was seen by currency traders as the main reason for the Swiss National Bank (SNB) ditching its three-year campaign to stop the franc damaging Swiss exports by becoming too strong against the euro. But with rich Russians looking for a safe haven during the recent rouble crisis, hot money has also been flowing into in recent weeks, adding to the SNB’s difficulties in holding down the franc. Swiss central bank chairman Thomas Jordan said that after more than three years in force the policy was no longer needed. The swiss franc/euro exchange rate did come back to a gain of 15% on the day. But Swiss businesses flatly rejected Jordan’s explanation. Banks, manufacturers and the tourist industry lined up to condemn the bank for its decision, which will make Swiss holidays and goods far more expensive. Manufacturers in Switzerland’s northern belt are likely to feel the impact first as their exports to Germany and other eurozone countries become far pricier. Nick Hayek, the chief executive of the Swatch watch group – which owns brands such as Omega, Longines, Tissot and Calvin Klein watches and jewellery – said: “Words fail me …today’s SNB action is a tsunami; for the export industry and for tourism, and finally for the entire country.” Swiss watchmakers are already grappling with weak demand in Asia, and are very exposed to moves in the exchange rate because they export almost all they produce. Shares in Swatch Group tumbled by 15%, while Richemont, which owns luxury names including Cartier, Montblanc and the fashion label Chloé, was down 14%. The London spread-betting business IG Group said bets on the Swiss franc could cost it as much as £30m. Julien Manceaux, analyst at ING Financial Markets, said the central bank’s cut in its interest rate to minus 0.75% “ensures the appetite for the franc as a safe haven will remain limited, avoiding a negative shock for the Swiss economy”. “This should work at least in the near term. Whether, this will still be the case after the ECB’s meeting on 22nd January and a likely QE announcement remains to be seen.” The tourism industry will be hard hit as the cost of holidays soars, with a sharp decline expected in bookings to Alpine ski resorts at a peak time for the industry. The euro declined to 0.80 francs before recovering slightly to stand at 1.03 francs. The franc also gained 25% against the dollar to trade at 0.89 francs per dollar. One investment firm was forced to admit that the sudden shift in the Swiss franc had cost it as much as £30m. The spike rise in the value of the Swiss franc came in early trading after the Swiss National Bank’s chairman Thomas Jordan said in a statement that the cap, introduced in September 2011, “protected the Swiss economy from serious harm” but was no longer justified. The bank said the measure, which in effectively pegged the Swiss franc to the euro, meant the franc has tracked the euro during a period when it has dropped sharply against the US dollar. Switzerland is seen by investors as a safe haven by wealthy investors and corporations fearful of destabilising developments in Russia and the Middle East. Investors have also flocked to Switzerland to escape ultra-low interest rates in the eurozone. Pressure has intensified on the franc since the ECB hinted that it would begin flooding the eurozone with cheap credit under a programme of quantitative easing (QE), a move expected to reduce long-term interest rates further and devalue the euro against other currencies. An advocate general’s ruling this week, likely to be accepted by the European Court of Justice, said the ECB was free to press ahead with bond buying without legal challenge. This intensified speculation that QE was imminent, forcing the SNB’s hand. The growing US economy, and the likelihood of an increase in interest rates this year, has also pushed the dollar higher, exacerbating the widening gap between the dollar and euro. At 11.00 the euro was down a cent against the dollar at $1.68 while the pound was up a cent at $1.52. The Swiss stock market collapsed 10%, or almost 1,000 points, to hit 8,205. With the likelihood of money flooding out of the eurozone in search of higher interest rates, the SNB’s cut in its deposit rate by 0.5 percentage points to -0.75 is intended to be a deterrent to investors thinking of Zurich as an alternative home for their investment savings.

2866	2867	G20 summit at odds over global recovery pact 	" arrived in South Korea tonight ahead of the G20 summit amid concerns that leaders of the world's most powerful nations will fail to agree rules designed to safeguard the global economic recovery, defuse trade tensions and prevent a repeat of the financial crisis. Gathering on a group of three islands specially built for the summit near Seoul, leaders will spend the next two days in fraught discussions about how to iron out the growing rifts between export-rich countries and debt-laden consumer nations. Protectionism and foreign exchange rates will be central to the debate. The United States wants China to allow the yuan to rise faster and believes that Beijing is keeping its currency low to gain a trade advantage. But the US negotiators face a rough ride, especially in the wake of last week's new $600bn round of quantitative easing, which has angered many G20 nations, including and Germany, who believe the move is designed to weaken the dollar – boosting US exports – and ignores the global repercussions it is likely to provoke. Already the euro is at a two-year high against the dollar. On the eve of the summit, president Robert Zoellick said the largest economies ""need pro-growth policies, structural reforms, open trade and an anti-protectionist agenda"". He said that further support from governments to support growth would build confidence in private sector development. Zoellick considers the return to growth in most developed countries to be fragile and is concerned that a slowdown next year could not only raise poverty levels in developing nations but also leave countries such as Ireland and Portugal to suffer deep cuts in wealth and social unrest. His comments were echoed by Bank of England governor , who warned that deep imbalances in the global economy must be tackled for recovery to gain traction. He urged leaders at the summit to end their bickering and agree plans to maintain growth. However, King's and Zoellick's calls for progress towards an international package of pro-growth economic and trade policies are likely to fall on deaf ears as debates are dominated by US proposals for the use of current account targets to help correct trade imbalances. has argued that without an agreement to limit the surge in trade surpluses accumulated by China and Germany, the US has no option but to boost its own economy by printing money. Brazil and Thailand, which have grown quickly since the banking crisis, are also affected and have slapped controls on foreign investment. They said they needed to prevent money pouring out of the US and artificially pushing up the price of domestic bonds, equities and property. Obama's hand was strengthened after China published figures showing its trade surplus hit $27.15bn (£19.66bn) last month after its exports leapt 22.9% in October from a year earlier, to a total of $135.98bn. Chancellor George Osborne has argued that while world growth remains steady and is expected to continue growing next year, Britain has an opportunity to rebalance its economy away from borrowing for consumption to export-led growth. Economic historian Robert Skidelsky has called Osborne's plan ""economically illiterate"" as it relied on other countries to buy British goods without Britain returning the favour. New financial regulations and rules governing how financial institutions should operate in the wake of the worst financial crisis since the second world war are also on the summit agenda. Expectations were running high earlier this year that leaders would agree tough measures to prevent banks taking excessive risks and reforms to global financial institutions to limit the scope for them to go bust. In June, the Toronto summit accepted that banks should face higher capital levels than previously envisaged to protect against a Lehman-style crisis ever happening again. But it marked a turning point after Britain joined Germany, China, Brazil and Canada to water down the timescale for implementation, leaving it to individual countries to introduce the new rules."

8844	8845	'We are unelectable everywhere and that is untenable' 	"The official line from the cabinet was business as usual. As John Denham, the skills secretary, and John Hutton, the business secretary, toured the TV news networks following Labour's devastating defeat in Glasgow East the message was familiar. The government is suffering the blowback from high global food and fuel prices and remains the best placed leader to take the party through difficult times. Behind the scenes it was a different story as former ministers and MPs contacted by the Guardian, many speaking only on condition of anonymity, sharpened the knives that may be plunged into the prime minister. ""We have moved from a one nation to a no nation party, thanks to Gordon,"" said one disgruntled former minister. ""We are unelectable everywhere, and that is untenable. By and large when something is untenable in politics something happens, and as yet I do not know what it will be."" This ominous assessment of Labour's position was shared by another MP in a rock solid seat. ""The problem for Gordon is that he now has a full deck of cards in terms of lost seats,"" the MP said. ""He has lost in London, he has lost in a Tory seat coming fifth in Henley, he has lost in a Midlands heartland seat and now he has lost in his own backyard. He has been rejected by every part of the country."" It was a withering assessment and it didn't get any better. ""We can no longer credibly claim to have a base,"" the MP continued. ""It has evaporated. As a result there can be no member of the parliamentary Labour party that can think he or she is safe in their seat. That is Gordon's problem. The question is what are we going to do about it, and if we are going to get rid of Gordon, it has to come from the cabinet."" Indeed many ministers yesterday regarded Glasgow East as a worse result than Crewe and Nantwich, not just because East was nominally safer than the Midlands seat but also because Labour lost on a relatively high turnout. The official prepared alibi if Labour lost would be to blame the low turnout. But the turnout was high. ""There was a spike in the vote after six o'clock as working age voters came out. We lost with our core vote,"" said one minister. Graham Stringer, the Manchester Blackley MP distinguished by his willingness to call in public for Brown to go, told the Guardian the prime minister had lost the support of the parliamentary party. ""A majority of Labour parliamentary private secretaries now think there should be a leadership election and the main debate is when it should take place,"" he said. ""I am absolutely certain from my personal knowledge that soundings are being taken from the top of government at the present time on how to get rid of him."" Former Blairites said the two men that would have to wield the knife were Jack Straw, the justice secretary, and Geoff Hoon, the chief whip, claiming they had ""a constitutional obligation to act"". Straw had a responsibility it was claimed because he knows what Labour in opposition is like and also what it is like to be led by an ineffectual leader. Hoon had a responsibility since he could tell the prime minister with authority if he had lost the confidence of his party. Hoon's aides dismissed suggestions he is beginning to lose faith in Brown or that he is annoyed that the prime minister has allowed a shadow whipping operation to be run by Hoon's deputy Nick Brown. Anti-Brownites claim Straw and Hoon have already had cabinet figures tell them that Brown has to go. ""There is a lot of pressure on them, and so there should be,"" said one minister. In what will inevitably be an operation run in great secrecy, it is very hard to discern whether the cabinet has given up on Brown, but it is undeniable that discussions are under way and a strategy is likely to emerge through August. One minister said: ""They are all fearful of acting alone. It could be very bloody and unpleasant. They keep finding excuses, but after Glasgow we do not need any more evidence that this man is unelectable."" It may be bravado but former Blairtes are warning that if the cabinet does not act before the party conference, there will be a revolt from below. ""The PLP is like a pressure cooker, and if the cabinet fails to act, the lid is going to blow, and it could be very messy,"" one Blairite said. Brown hopes to recharge his batteries on holiday and is planning to come back with a two-stage strategy based around an economic plan that unfolds first in September and then further at the party conference in Manchester. In his speech to the Labour policy forum in Warwick yesterday he highlighted fresh measures to protect the electorate from the impact of rising energy prices, as well as the threat of home repossessions. He believes there is some sign that oil and food prices will ease, but he also knows that price rises by energy companies could mean an increasing amount of disposable income will go on warming homes this winter. There may also be a cabinet reshuffle in which Blairites such as Alan Milburn may be brought in. In his speech yesterday Brown stuck to a familiar script about the international long-term challenges facing the country. One ministerial aide was deeply depressed by the performance saying: ""He should have taken his jacket off and just ripped into the Tories. We got the standard speech about 'because we own the past we can own the future'. The record has got to change fast."" Brown's allies say he needs to find the language to connect with working class voters struggling with the impact of globalisation with some privately admitting that if the economy does not improve by 2010, he will lose. Yet as one senior party figure said yesterday: ""I have been on the phone all day, and I have not spoken to a single person who thinks it is all simply to do with fuel prices. There is a concern running through the cabinet about Gordon ... I do not think he will be prime minister by Christmas. Gordon does not have the only vote in all this."" Labour records its poorest local election results in 40 years, including the loss of the London mayoralty Tories snatch Crewe and Nantwich in a byelection with a 17.6% swing Tories win the Henley byelection, with Labour beaten into fifth place Labour suffers defeat to the SNP in Glasgow East, while also losing the Church Street seat in the Westminster city council by-election, with a Tory returned for the first time in the ward"	Politics
14789	14790	Treasury's 80:20 plan that may end up £250bn adrift 	"The 80:20 rule applies to the government's austerity policies: about 20% of the Treasury plan for rebuilding public finances rests on tax rises, while 80% comes from reductions in spending. In the current phase, welfare spending faces the biggest squeeze. Back in 2010, in the immediate aftermath of the general election, all eyes in the coalition were on the figure for annual public sector net borrowing. This measure shows how much debt is added to the government's mountain of IOUs each year. It was expected to fall only marginally from the record £156bn set in 2009 by the Labour administration. The cabinet agreed a plan to bring the annual overspend down from almost 12% of GDP to less than 3% by 2015-16, which was two years faster than Labour believed possible. Tax rises were the first to take effect. An increase in VAT to 20% was allied to a rise in capital gains tax and a £2bn levy on the banks. George Osborne also implemented Labour's 50p top rate of tax for people earning more than £150,000. In the slipstream came cuts to Whitehall and local authority spending designed to help the government achieve budget cuts – after inflation – averaging 25% over four years. Health, education and international aid budgets were spared the axe, leaving other departments to take even bigger hits. Public sector workers suffered a pay freeze and then a 1% cap. Osborne planned to impose drastic cuts on welfare spending in 2013, but he expected the economy to be in better shape. In 2010, many analysts said the government's hope was that a recovery would be in full swing by this year and welfare cuts would be quietly forgotten. However, two key elements of the Treasury's plans have gone awry. By 2013 the economy was supposed to be 6.3% larger, but instead it delivered a double-dip recession and over 2011 and 2012 in effect flatlined. With growth nonexistent, tax revenues were lower than expected and it became harder to reduce government spending. The Treasury's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), expected the annual deficit to be £89bn in 2012-13 and then £60bn in 2013-14. In his most recent budget Osborne conceded that borrowing would be £120bn in both years, adding to a debt accumulator total that most experts believe will be £250bn higher than the OBR expected to be run up over five years when the plan was hatched in 2010. Another element, the cost of implementing Iain Duncan Smith's universal credit, which has needed considerable funds for new computer systems and administration before the largely online scheme begins to save money, was initially underestimated. It is due to go live for new claimants in October, but three out of four ""pathfinder projects"" were delayed last week and the October start date may also be deferred. In the meantime, the government has saved £432m by cutting 10% from the council tax benefit grant to local authorities. The Resolution Foundation thinktank believes the move, which scraps the grant and replaces it with a payment worth 90% of its value, will hit 3.2m low-income households who pay no council tax or a reduced charge.

3782	3783	Google Earth and drones help save Kenya’s elephants 	Conservationist Marc Goss touches “take off” on his 3, sending a $300 AR Drone whirring into the air - his latest weapon to fight elephant poachers around Kenya’s Maasai Mara National Reserve. “It’s an arms race,” said Goss, whose green khaki clothing shields him from thorny acacia branches in the 30,000 hectares (74,132 acres) of savanna he protects. “We’re seeing larger numbers of poachers.” Besides the almost 2 foot-long drone, Goss and other conservationists are using night-vision goggles and Earth to halt the decline of Kenya’s wildlife, which helps attract $1bn a year in tourism. With elephant ivory sold for as much as $1,000 a kilogram in Hong Kong, Kenya is facing its most serious threat from poaching in almost a quarter of a century, according to the United Nations. At least 232 elephants have been killed in the year to the end of September, adding to 384 last year from a population of 40,000. Demand for illicit ivory from expanding economies such as China and Thailand has doubled since 2007, according to the UN Environment Programme. Goss’s patch borders the Maasai Mara National Reserve, where semi-nomadic tribesmen, known as the Maasai, wearing checked-red robes herd their cows. On a warm morning he squints through the bush at a tusk-less elephant carcass, surrounded by 10 of its grieving family members in the hills above the village of Aitong. “It’s pretty grim,” Goss, a 28-year-old Kenyan who manages the Mara Elephant Project, said as he stood 50 metres (55 yards) from the carcass. “It’s an elephant without a face. It’ll be eaten by hyenas now.” Poachers had speared the pachyderm in her back. Its ivory would be worth more than $8,000 in Asia. The carcass was the third found in four days, an unusually high number, Goss said. One was shot with an automatic rifle and the other animal was also pierced. When he started using the drones, Goss thought they would help mainly with providing aerial footage of the landscape and tracking poachers armed with rifles and the Maasai who sometimes killed the animals when they interfere with the grazing of their cows. He soon discovered they could help by frightening the elephants, keeping them out of harm’s way. “We realised very quickly that the elephants hated the sound of them,” said Goss, whose week-old beard goes white near his temples. “I’m assuming that they think it’s a swarm of bees.” Goss and his team have put collars with global positioning system devices on 15 elephants so they can be tracked on a computer overlaying their paths on Google Earth. That way the animals, who have names such as Madde, after Goss’s wife, Fred, Hugo and Polaris, can be followed to see if they’ve strayed into areas at risk of poaching or human conflict. Goss hopes to buy 10 more drones and to modify them by adding a mechanism that releases capsaicin, the active component in chili pepper, when elephants stray near dangerous areas. Paint balls loaded with chili pepper are being used in Zambia’s lower Zambezi region to deter elephants from high-risk zones. “Drones are basically the future of conservation; a drone can do what 50 rangers can do,” said James Hardy, a fourth-generation Kenyan and manager of the Mara North Conservancy. “It’s going to reach a point where drones are on the forefront of poaching. At night time we could use it to pick up heat signatures of poachers, maybe a dead elephant if we’re quick enough.” East Africa is a key battleground against the poaching of elephants, whose numbers in are estimated between 419,000 and 650,000, according to the 178-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, better known as Cites. is proposing stiffer penalties for the slaughter of elephants and rhinos, with fines of as much as 10m Kenyan shillings ($117,000) and 15-year jail terms. The government has deployed paramilitary forces and plans to acquire drones to fight poaching. The development of new towns and urban sprawl in Kenya is intensifying the conflict between humans and elephants. The UN says the country’s population has more than doubled to about 43.2 million people in the past two decades. “Kenya very soon will have to make some tough decisions on how to manage the elephant population because they will be at high levels of human-elephant conflict,” said Matthew Lewis, senior programme officer of the WWF’s African species conservation programme. Across the Maasai Mara, which means spotted land in Swahili, Calvin Cottar uses a €86,000 ($116,000) gyrocopter to enforce land agreements he made with neighboring Maasai communities. His camp, part of Cheli & Peacock’s safari lodge portfolio, is built on plots he leases from the Maasai for $45 to $50 an acre. As part of the deal they won’t graze their cattle on areas that Cottar is trying to conserve. “A big issue we have is night-time surveillance,” he said. “I can’t use the gyro at night so we’ll probably resort to using these drones.” Later, Cottar sits at a wooden table where a member of the Kenya Wildlife Service recounts the previous evening’s close call. With his G3 rifle leaning against a concrete wall, the ranger eats a lunch of rice and beans as he tells Cottar that he thinks an elephant was shot and wounded for its ivory. The rangers are planning a night-time operation nearby. Anti-poaching forces only fire on illegal hunters if they have guns, said Cottar, who runs a 1920s colonial-style safari camp with his wife Louise. “It could have been poachers, so now we’re setting a trap for them,” said Cottar, who hunted game in Tanzania in the 1980s. “If they see someone with a gun, those rangers will shoot them. If they’re without a gun, they’ll chase them.”	Technology
13490	13491	The Klinsmann effect: for USA fans, Germany's compromises feel familiar 	When Germany take on Brazil in the World Cup semi-final on Tuesday, Jogi Löw’s coaching legacy may not be the only one on the line. Löw's players have found success over the last month in part by abandoning a free-flowing style that was introduced to the German national team before the 2006 , as part of an ideological overhaul implemented by Löw and Jürgen Klinsmann. Klinsmann, of course, is now in charge of the USA. He will look on from a distance on Tuesday, his team having shown signs of progress mixed with similar pragmatism before being in the round of 16. The question for American soccer fans, then, is what does the evolution (or regression) of under Klinsmann's protégé, Löw mean for their own team's prospects, not least as it continues to field and pursue German-born talent? In typified by ' barging run to head the only goal from a set-piece and subsequent muscular defensive performance, it was clear Löw had added a pragmatic physicality to his team – even going so far as to practise, shudder, set-pieces. It seemed consistent with a tournament in which a giddy group stage has given way to cautious realpolitick among all the favourites. For some it was the death-knell for a project that started in 2004, when with Germany in disarray Klinsmann was appointed to guide the team through its own 2006 World Cup. There is a feeling in German football that perhaps the federation didn’t know what it was getting itself into with the appointment of Klinsmann, who used a brief that went well beyond the first team to weed out ultra-conservative members of the governing body, institute fitness regimes and tests that tied the federation and Bundesliga more closely together, and generally use his force of personality and legendary status to force through reforms few others would have had the capital to try. Certainly the revisionism that credits Löw as the tactical brain behind the 2006 World Cup campaign neglects the platform provided by Klinsmann. Löw was a relatively minor figure in the German game when he was made Klinsmann’s assistant, yet he was given space and support to help develop the new blueprint. Klinsmann, the figurehead, was busy fending off conservative pushback while giving young German players the belief that they would be hailed as reformers rather than reckless vandals. Despite public criticism and pressure before the 2006 tournament, the Germans played with style and verve – if not quite enough guile to get past . After that, with Löw in sole charge and Klinsmann about to discover the limits of his iconoclasm at Bayern Munich, they fell short in , then reached the semi-finals at the and . In doing so they were breathtakingly fast on the counter, compact in defence and were fun to watch. They made friends. But they didn’t win any tournaments. This was not the ruthless late-20th-century Germany – arguably, this was a version of the talented sides those Germans beat: the French, the Dutch and the English of 1990 and 1996. While the fitness reforms Klinsmann instituted are still standard practice at national and club level in Germany, and while the technical emphasis for young German players has shifted definitively, there is still a feeling in the country that one of the great European footballing powers could be about to let a golden generation fall through its fingers. Even Klinsmann acknowledges the nagging doubt around the team. When , we were discussing England’s chances when he broke off to offer an unprompted comparison: If you compare a little bit to Germany, Germany’s a side that can win the World Cup, is among the top three right now in the world, and it’s also a very special generation that is there. But at the end of the day that generation has to put the dot on the 'i' to make the final step to win a competition like that – otherwise you go down as an amazing generation without winning a big tournament. Could they do so while being true to their hard-won attacking ideals? In the opening game, , it really looked that way, as the Pepe-less Portuguese were cut to ribbons, but by the time Germany rumbled past France in the last eight the iconic image was not a sweeping counter ending in a Thomas Müller finish, but a set-piece on to the head of Hummels, who manhandled his defender to where he wanted him before glancing a header to the far post. Hummels trotted back to the other end of the field and began playing with the kind of earnest muscularity that had demoralised generations of opponents before the advent of Klinsmann and Löw. The French limped off, their own flair and promise relegated to a footnote. Now Löw's team face Luiz Felipe Scolari’s Brazil, whose own mix of physicality and magic lost the magic with . There is a fair argument that of two teams who have abandoned their historical principles, the Germans are closer to coming full-circle. And yet, the Klinsmann/Löw project has created that somewhere in the next two games we will see some flair from the Germans. Just as Louis van Gaal could win with Holland but not escape the legacy of Total Football if his side did not thrill, Löw and his one-time mentor have created a set of ideals that German football never knew it wanted. There is a subplot to all this of course, which is the expectation of progress against which USA fans this past week. When Klinsmann was brought into the job, he promised a more attacking style. That promise has been under scrutiny since the defeat by Belgium. For long stretches of the USA’s World Cup, their tactics looked like rope-a-dope – without the dope. The defence conceded width and gambled on a resolute ability to defend crosses – and Belgium racked up record tallies of crosses and shots, and like a force of nature to stop them. Add to that the timidity shown , bar one injury time surge, and we’re left with minutes five through 95 and minutes 115 to 130 against Belgium as the periods to which Klinsmann can point if he wants to display something resembling the loose adaptation of his German model he wanted when he started the job. Needless to say, critics have been quick to point to this and the fact that USA fell behind at exactly the same stage in two consecutive World Cups (a third-minute goal in second-round extra-time) as evidence that no progress has been made. This seems a particularly fatuous argument, but it does show that Klinsmann the moderniser is on a short leash. Klinsmann will point to his time in the Germany job and in particular his experience at Bayern Munich, shrug, and say “What’s new?” He will also point, as will US Soccer president Sunil Gulati, to progress made on the technical development side of the job – progress which was the basis, Gulati claims, of Klinsmann’s contract being renewed early this spring. This progress is visible not so much in player production but in building paths and monitoring systems by and through which young players will pass if one of the most diffuse and challenging national systems on the planet ever coheres into more than the sum of its many parts. One component of that system will involve finding players among the estimated 3 million expat Americans around the world, among whom Klinsmann has already successfully sourced players – including a number of children of American servicemen in Germany who have been plucked from a system he knows so well. (born in Berlin), Julian Green (born in Tampa, raised in Germany) and Jermaine Jones (born in Frankfurt) were all wooed to declare for the USA and all scored in the World Cup. The right-back Fabian Johnson (born in Munich) was arguably the USA’s most exciting player. Also arguably, given Jozy Altidore’s injury, the biggest absence from the roster was not Landon Donovan but another big forward, the Bremen-born Terrence Boyd. Klinsmann seems to have become more ambitious about the players he approaches, with Green the latest and, being on Bayern Munich’s books, arguably the biggest coup of the lot. There could even be a bigger swoop to come, however, if the Berlin-born Arsenal midfielder Gedion Zelalem – as he has suggested he will. In matters of talent and style, Klinsmann is evidently still looking to Germany – even if Germany is looking less and less to him.	Football
2195	2196	Louis Zamperini obituary 	"A star runner, war hero, and survivor of 47 days at sea in a rubber raft and two years of torture in Japanese prison camps, Louis Zamperini, who has died aged 97, experienced the sort of life that was the stuff of Hollywood movies. And 71 years after he was declared killed in action in the Pacific, four years after of him became a bestseller, Hollywood got the message. Angelina Jolie's film Unbroken, with and a screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen, will be released in December. Zamperini was born in Olean, New York, to Italian immigrants who moved to Torrance, California, when he was three. He still had not learned English, and was bullied. His father, a labourer, taught him boxing, and Zamperini so enjoyed defeating his bullies that he became a young terror, in and out of trouble. Not until his older brother Pete talked him into joining the track team at Torrance high school were his energies directed into more constructive channels. In 1934 at the Los Angeles Coliseum, Zamperini ran mile in 4min 21.2 sec, setting a national high school record that stood for 20 years. He won a scholarship to the University of Southern California (USC), and in 1936 moved up to 5,000m for the US Olympic trials, finishing in a dead heat with the world record holder Don Lash. In Berlin, where his room-mate , he finished 8th in the Olympic final, but he stunned the crowd with a 56-second final lap. Afterwards, standing with a group of runners in front of Adolf Hitler, but unable to take a photo, he handed his camera to a thin man standing nearby, and Joseph Goebbels snapped a shot for him. Hitler then shook his hand, saying ""You're the boy with the fast finish."" Once the dignitaries were gone, Zamperini sparked a small incident when he shinned up a flagpole to take away the Fuhrer's personal standard. At USC his finishing kick saw him called ""The Torrance Tornado"", and in 1938 his 4min 8.3sec mile set a US college record that lasted 15 years. He was considered a leading candidate to break the four-minute mile, and a favourite for the 1940 Tokyo Olympics, which were cancelled when the second world war broke out. Zamperini enlisted in the army in September 1941, and after the US entered the war the following December flew B-24s from the island of Funafuti. In May 1943, his crew was assigned to search for a lost bomber, and given a spare plane thought to be mechanically jinxed. When its engine exploded, they crashed into the ocean; eight of the 11-man crew died. Zamperini and two others survived in a life raft. They lived on rainwater, albatross and the occasional fish, and were beset by storms, sharks and strafing from passing Japanese planes. After 47 days, two of the three, Zamperini and co-pilot Russell Phillips reached the Marshall Islands and were captured. Zamperini weighed 75lbs. As he recalled: ""I thought to myself, six weeks ago I was a world-class athlete. And then, for the first time in my life, I was scared."" In his first prison camp, Zamperini's renown earned him the enmity of the notorious Japanese army sergeant Mutsuhiro Watanabe, known to prisoners as The Bird. He was tortured repeatedly. ""I could take the beatings and physical punishment,"" he later said. ""But it was the attempt to destroy your dignity, to make you a nonentity, that was the hardest thing to bear."" Zamperini had been reported missing in action, and in June 1943 his parents received the telegram from the president declaring him killed. But later Zamperini was transferred away from Watanabe, to help make a radio broadcast home. When he refused to make a second, condemning the US, he was transferred to another camp where Watanabe was now commandant. After the war ended, Watanabe was listed 23rd among the top 40 war criminals sought by the Americans, but escaped and went into hiding. Zamperini returned to Los Angeles and married Cynthia Applewhite in 1946. However, he suffered from what we now call post-traumatic stress disorder, and began drinking heavily. In 1949, Cynthia took him to a rally staged by the evangelist Billy Graham, and then to a second, where Louis was overcome and born-again as a Christian. He became an inspirational speaker and youth worker, while working in commercial real estate, and in 1950 accompanied missionaries to Japan, where he contacted those who had tortured him and greeted them with forgiveness. He stayed active physically, saying ""the war took 10 years off my life. I decided to get the 10 years back."" In 1984 he carried an Olympic torch into the same Coliseum where he had set records as a youth, and for the 1998 winter Games in Nagano he again joined the torch relay, carrying the Olympic flame past one of the prison camps where he had been tortured. By then, Watanabe had resurfaced as a successful businessman, and Zamperini wrote him a letter of forgiveness, offering to meet. Watanabe refused, but gave an interview to the American TV show 60 Minutes, saying he had treated Zamperini only as ""an enemy of Japan"". Zamperini published two memoirs, different books with the same title, Devil at My Heels. The first, in 1956, written with Helen Itris, was optioned by Universal as a vehicle for , but he went on to make Spartacus instead. The second, done with David Rensin, appeared in 2003. But it was not until Hillenbrand, who had previously written , the story of the great racehorse, published Unbroken, that Zamperini's story gained traction. When Jolie was drawn to the story, she discovered that he lived just down the street from her. Torrance's airport and high school stadium are both named after Zamperini, as is the plaza outside the stadium at USC. When asked to describe his own indomitable spirit, he said ""the only way I can put it that makes sense is that every athlete wants to win."" Cynthia died in 2001, and he is survived by a daughter, Cynthia, and a son, Luke. Louis Silvie Zamperini, athlete and soldier, born 26 January 1917; died 2 July 2014"	Film
7563	7564	SNP seeking greater powers, slowly 	Angus Robertson, the Scottish National party’s Westminster leader, has signalled that his party wants to slowly negotiate the transfer of even greater tax and welfare powers to . Robertson indicated the SNP had no plans to demand a fast transfer of extra welfare, job-creating and tax powers for Holyrood despite huge its gains in the general election, based partly on demanding “full financial responsibility” for Scotland. Using far more cautious language than seen from the SNP during the election campaign, Robertson linked with the need to take a slow and realistic approach to new powers. “I want to see maximum decision-making in Scotland as soon we possibly can,” Robertson told BBC Radio Scotland, as the SNP’s new group of 56 MPs travelled to Westminster to take up their posts on Monday morning. “Unfortunately, the most important thing to be aware of and to recognise and respect is that Scotland voted no in the referendum last year, which means we can’t realistically have all the powers we want to have as quickly as possible. “It’s going to be a matter which is subject to discussion between the Scottish government and the UK government.” Robertson’s gradualist approach implies it could take the rest of the decade to implement any extra further powers and also suggests the SNP will attempt to postpone a second independence referendum. It is doubly significant because it counters immediate fears voiced by senior Tories that the SNP’s remarkable performance could force the UK into giving much more radical powers to Scotland. Boris Johnson, the London mayor, and Jeremy Hunt suggested in the immediate aftermath of the election that the UK could need to consider a federalist solution or offer sweeping new powers. But the SNP is privately worried about the economic implications of pressing for full fiscal autonomy because the collapse in the North Sea oil price has weakened Scotland’s financial position. And opinion polls continue to show a majority against independence, despite last week’s huge vote for the SNP. In effect rejecting the far more bullish stance on demanding extra powers taken by former leader Alex Salmond on Saturday, Robertson said there was now a “roadmap” for introducing new powers, which would mean a delay of several years before they were put to the Commons. That began with implementing the Smith Commission proposals for full control over income tax, housing benefit and other modest powers – measures the SNP has repeatedly rejected as insufficient and inadequate but will take several years to come into force. “We know there’s a roadmap forward. Firstly, it’s delivery of the Smith Commission proposals, secondly it’s following the discussion of further powers beyond that, which will emerge from discussions between the first minister and the prime minister,” Robertson said. “And then there will be vigorous debate in the House of Commons during this parliamentary term and about the additional powers that we can hope realistically to have further devolved.” Robertson also said the SNP would vote alongside David Cameron’s Tory government on pro-European Union votes in the Commons. Asked if the SNP would support the Tories on remaining in the EU, he said: “I can support Scotland and the UK remaining part of the EU regardless of who proposes that. If the position is, we can stay in, then I would welcome that.” Robertson confirmed that the SNP was again calling for the UK government to abolish the Scotland Office – a demand likely to be rejected out of hand by Cameron’s government. “In the past it has been, in effect, just a propaganda unit of the UK government to counter the SNP,” Robertson said.

10047	10048	The Overnight: swinging without the sniggering 	o one wants the phrase “adult movies” showing up on their bank statement. But a film like makes you want to reclaim those disreputable words on behalf of cinema genuinely made with adults in mind. Emily (Taylor Schilling) and Alex (Adam Scott), recently arrived in Los Angeles with their young son, are trying to work out where they fit in – not only in their new neighbourhood, but with one another. The opening scene demonstrates that their sex life has its shortcomings and that this awkwardness extends beyond the bedroom. While Emily works, Alex takes their nipper to the playground, where father and son start casting around rather forlornly for new friends. Well, be careful what you wish for. Into Alex and Emily’s life strolls Kurt (Jason Schwartzman), who is worryingly groovy (“You have a blinding aura of goodness and light”) and also suspiciously eager to welcome them into the home he shares with his French wife, Charlotte (Judith Godrèche). The bulk of the movie depicts in painful and painstaking detail the evening that these new BFFs spend together: the bonhomie, the booze, the bongs. Are they four adults on a play date, or are Alex and Emily being groomed for something more sordid? Long before Kurt invites Alex to come upstairs to see his etchings – or, in this case, down into the Freudian basement to see his paintings of buttholes – there is something off-kilter about him. Schwartzman never lets us know exactly what Kurt wants. And the film itself is no easier to pin down. On the one hand, it shows us Kurt clearly pressuring Alex and Emily – he’s adept at making them feel gauche whenever they resist one of his suggestions. Then again, it is through his challenges that their relationship is tested and even fortified. The moral certainties in the movie keep shifting, along with our allegiances. Cinema has tended to be both prurient and censorious on the subject of swinging. Coming at the end of the 1960s, Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice removed some of the shine from free love, questioning the gains that come with disinhibition. The Ice Storm, made in 1997 but set at the start of the 1970s, went one further, using key parties and partner-swapping as a harbinger of doom and even death. is smarter than either. Like I Love You, Man, it broaches the question of loneliness in adulthood. Along with Humpday (which starred Mark Duplass, one of the producers of The Overnight), it nudges at the limits of the bromance – though it goes where that film feared to tread. It also casts an interrogative light on relationships that is distinct from the sitcom-esque tenor that usually surrounds the subject. Indeed, it’s what This Is 40 might have been if the number in the title hadn’t referred to the percentage of its insights that rang true.	Film
13712	13713	Belgium 1-0 Russia 	If there was one man you could guarantee would stand aloof from the general joie de vivre of this World Cup, it was . He is living this World Cup as he lived the last, grimly battering away criticism as drab tournament performances fail to live up to the promise of qualifying. The Sovetsky Sport columnist Yury Tsyban had described Capello’s football as being whisky after the champagne of Guus Hiddink at the Euros in 2008; this felt more like a £3.99 cava grabbed as a last resort at the garage on the way home after a late night. Not that Belgium were much better. They had offered almost nothing in the second half before suddenly being stimulated by a Kevin Mirallas free-kick that hit the post with seven minutes remaining. , uninvolved until then, woke up and, after having a shot deflected wide for a corner, set up the winner with a darting run to the byline, before cutting the ball back for Divock Origi to take his time and smash a shot past Igor Akinfeev. All three of Belgium’s goals at this tournament have been scored by substitutes, which has brought two victories and passage to the last 16, but it was another scratchy display from a side widely tipped as potential winners. It was another disappointing day for Romelu Lukaku, who struggled to impose himself and was clearly frustrated to be withdrawn early in the second half, by which point he had played 113 minutes in this and touched the ball in the opposition penalty area only once. “We didn’t play a very good match,” Hazard said. “The last 10 minutes were good, that’s all. It was complicated for Romelu – he didn’t have much space. Divock took advantage of the space at the end of the match.” Origi, who has been at Lille for two years and turned 19 in April, would not be in the squad but for the injury to Christian Benteke. “I’ve followed him in the last four months,” said Marc Wilmots. “He has the profile of a young player but he is disciplined and fast. Nobody knew him when I first fielded him but you can see his qualities, the way he has integrated into the team.” Capello spent the majority of the game standing in the corner of his technical area, arms folded, sleeves of his blue shirt thrust up to the elbows, leaning slightly backwards in that disdainful way he has, glowering at the dour midfield tussle in front of him as the two 4-2-3-1s cancelled each other out. Given how poor had been in their opening game, that was perhaps all Capello ever intended: a desperate scrap between six players in the middle of the pitch with everybody else involved only peripherally. “I thought it was an excellent match,” he insisted. “It was played at great pace and great intensity. Because of the intensity we made mistakes but so did they.” The Italian had resisted calls to introduce the more flamboyant Alan Dzagoev or even Aleksandr Kerzhakov, who had come off the bench to score the equaliser against South Korea. He did, though, bring in the 22-year-old forward Maksim Kanunnikov, for just his third cap as Russia looked to exploit the occasional clumsiness of Toby Alderweireld at right-back. Every Russian attack in the first half – not that there were many – seemed to go down that flank, but too often their passing was too sedate and their threat was limited. With Dries Mertens at the heart of most of what attacking threat presented early on, most of the first half was played in one half of the pitch, as though both teams had decided to make the most of the sunshine and avoid the shade on the other flank. It was from the sunshine that Russia produced their only real chance: an Aleksandr Kokorin header that flashed wide at the end of the first half. “Physically we were stronger, fitter,” said Wilmots. “I think the Russian team needed another 10 or 15 minutes in them: you could see some players were looking at their feet.” It was for that reason that Hazard capitalised. “He dribbles very well,” Belgium’s coach added. “He looks for spaces but you have to be patient.” Belgium did just enough and could easily have added to their lead as Russia chased the game in the closing minutes. Russia, meanwhile, can only try to beat Algeria in their final match and hope that is enough to make it through. For Capello, this World Cup may turn out to be even worse than that of four years ago.

6470	6471	Sony annual losses triple to £731m 	 has posted a ¥138bn (£808m) quarterly loss – owing to costs from exiting its personal computer business – and has forecast more red ink as it struggles to execute a long-promised turnaround. The Tokyo-based electronics firm also reported on Wednesday a loss of ¥128.4bn for the fiscal year to end of March, more than three times the ¥41.5bn loss in the previous year. Sony forecasts a ¥50bn loss for the year ending March 2015. Earlier this month, the firm said it would report a bigger annual loss than earlier forecast because of costs related to selling its Vaio PC business. It was also hit by a drop in the value of its overseas disc manufacturing business and its battery business. The Playstation 4 maker has lost much of the cachet that stemmed from once being at the cutting edge of consumer electronics. In recent years it has fallen behind in digital recorders and flat-panel TVs while also facing competition from a host of new rivals that can make appliances at lower costs. In gadgetry, it is Apple and Samsung that have dazzled with their innovations, not Sony. In February, Sony announced it would withdraw from the PC business, despite the popularity of the Vaio brand among some Sony fans, especially in . The deal to sell Vaio to a Japanese conglomerate was signed this month. The transaction is expected to be completed in July. The firm's losses are continuing despite an improvement in sales, which rose by 14% to ¥7.7tn for the fiscal year. Sony is also struggling despite the perk that Japanese exporters such as it get from a favourable exchange rate, which boosts the value of overseas earnings. The dollar has strengthened over the past year to about ¥102 from ¥80. Sony said it trimmed losses at its TV operations, which have been struggling for nearly a decade, a big problem for a company that had built its reputation on the fantastic image quality of its televisions. Sony is splitting off its money-losing TV division to run it as a wholly owned subsidiary.	Technology
4811	4812	Chelsea sign Nemanja Matic from Benfica on five-and-a-half-year deal 	"Chelsea have bolstered their Premier League title challenge by completing the eye-catching signing of Nemanja Matic from , with the Serbia midfielder's €25m (£20.75m) arrival the most expensive outlay by a British club in the transfer window thus far. Matic has signed a contract until 2019 and rejoins the London club, who sit third in the table and just two points from the leaders Arsenal, having spent three years establishing his reputation in Portugal. The 25-year-old passed a medical at Cobham on Wednesday and, once international clearance has come through, will be in line to make his second debut for in Sunday's eagerly anticipated meeting with Manchester United. The size of the fee feels startling given that Matic had been considered little more than a £3m makeweight in the £23.5m deal that brought David Luiz from the Estádio da Luz three years ago. Yet Matic has developed rapidly at Benfica as a key member of Jorge Jesus's side and, having been linked heavily with a return to London last summer, pushed for the deal this month. José Mourinho had indicated to Chelsea's board that Matic should be prioritised as part of the continuing reinvention of his side. ""I am very pleased that Nemanja is returning to Chelsea,"" said the manager. ""He has grown as a player in Portugal and has become a fantastic all-round midfielder. I am sure he will become a very important member of the squad and help us to achieve our ambitions."" The fee will largely be offset by the sale of the unsettled Kevin De Bruyne to Wolfsburg for £18m, representing a profit on the Belgian of around £11m. Matic, capped nine times, will compete with Mikel John Obi, Frank Lampard – who has recovered from a hamstring injury and is contention to feature against United –and Ramires for a starting place in central midfield. The Serb had originally moved to Chelsea from Kosice for £1.5m in 2009, having been recruited by the then sporting director Frank Arnesen, but made only three appearances as a substitute before heading to Vitesse Arnhem on a season's loan. Benfica earmarked him then as a priority makeweight when the London club sought to recruit David Luiz and he impressed against his former club in . ""I am very happy for this opportunity to be back at this club,"" said Matic, who had blossomed with responsibility in Portugal after Javi García departed the Lisbon club for Manchester City in 2012. ""I feel very good because of that and just want to say I will give my best to help the team and make the Chelsea fans happy."" The 6ft 4in midfielder will wear the No21 shirt, with Chelsea having insisted this time around that no young players would be moving to Portugal in part-exchange. The Serb will not be eligible for his new club's Champions League campaign this season having featured in the competition for Benfica, and it remains to be seen whether Chelsea now sanction the veteran midfielder Michael Essien's departure with six months of his contract to run. Matic's signing may conclude Chelsea's incoming business this month, though strong interest is retained in the highly rated St-Etienne defender Kurt Zouma. That deal may be progressed in January but, if no agreement is reached, the club may revisit the issue at the end of the season. Southampton's young left-back Luke Shaw is also attracting their attention, with events at St Mary's being closely monitored."	Football
6721	6722	The Co-op Group is in turmoil: the cooperative movement isn't 	"nother week, another five days of upheaval at the Co-operative Group: its management shaken up and its annual results delayed for three weeks – when £2bn of losses are expected. Britain's biggest mutual has been branded ""ungovernable"" (by its former boss Euan Sutherland when he quit) and accused of organisational chaos that has cost it billions (by its independent director Paul Myners). The scandal has cast a long shadow over the mutual model – even the Co-op's bank is no longer 100% mutually owned and faces speculation it will delay its own results due this week – but the Co-op Group is just one of more than 6,000 cooperatives operating in Britain and many of them are thriving. From pubs and football clubs to engineering firms with export order books many public companies would beg for, the co-op model is the basis for successful businesses up and down Britain. The origins of Britain's cooperative movement go back as far the 18th century when workers or consumers banded together to found businesses in mutual self-interest. Then, in 1844, the Rochdale pioneers, the founders of what became the Co-op Group, set down the principles that have guided the development of the sector. Cooperatives are owned by their members, whether employees, customers, a group of companies or a mixture. The members are supposed to have a say in the company's running and a share in its performance, and are meant to work for the greater good. The Co-op Group, spanning supermarkets, funeral parlours, pharmacies and banking, has been the talisman for the movement: a business with a £14bn annual turnover that was seemingly able to take on Tesco and Barclays while espousing ethical principles and low-risk activities – until it nearly went bust. Myners has argued that the Co-op Group itself has been in decline for many years, with its profile maintained only by disastrous deals such as the takeovers of Somerfield supermarkets and Britannia building society. But while the UK economy was in or near recession between 2008 and 2012, the number of cooperatives in the wider movement rose 28% to 6,169 and turnover jumped 23% to £6.2bn, according to trade body Co-operatives UK. Ed Mayo, chief executive of Co-operatives UK, says: ""In a tough economy it makes commercial sense to have those close to you onside. Being a cooperative is a different way of doing business, which gives ownership not to external investors but to those most directly involved. ""The key for success is then to use that difference to create a competitive advantage. Cooperatives tend to operate with a more committed workforce and a more engaged and loyal customer base – meaning that sharing ownership can be a way to get ahead."" The most visible cooperative businesses are the groceries like those first established by the Rochdale pioneers. As well as the supermarkets, there are hundreds of small retail operations and several large independent retail cooperatives, including Midcounties, the biggest, and Southern. Both have performed strongly while the Co-op Group has floundered – Southern increased revenue by 26% between 2010 and 2013 to £327m with profits up 28%. Last year it spent £450,000 on community projects. By contrast, Myners has accused the Group of neglecting basic retailing and giving up all the market share it gained with the 2009 takeover of Somerfield. Founded 140 years ago, Southern operates 187 convenience stores in the south of England as well as funeral homes and a crematorium. Gemma Lacey, its head of sustainability, says remaining a regional business has kept it closer to its members. Unlike the Co-op Group, which claims 8 million members but only lets regional representatives into its annual meeting, any of Southern's 145,000 members can go to its AGM and more than 300 turned up last year. ""A clear difference for us is our independence and our regional and local focus. All our growth plans are focused on our regional perspective and that plays out in our community programme,"" Lacey says. Co-op Group members were furious when it announced the planned sale of its farms, which it started to buy in the late 1890s to safeguard the supply of produce. But the group's farms are dwarfed by those worked by members of producer cooperatives. These range in size from giant dairy operations Milk Link and First Milk, agrifood business Fane Valley and farming supplies co-operative Mole Valley, down to crop growers that have banded together. Snaith Salad Growers, based in Carlton, Yorkshire, has 14 members and produces about 15m lettuces a year. Simon Deighton, Snaith's general manager, says being a cooperative gives the farms ""strength in unity"" to secure cheaper goods, big contracts from Asda and Sainsbury's and grants from the European Union for equipment and technical help. ""The members of our cooperative wouldn't be very likely to get a contract with a major supermarket individually but combined we can offer more cover and security of supply,"" he says. Britain's most famous conversion to mutual status is the John Lewis Partnership, whose owner signed his department stores over to his employees in 1929. John Lewis is held up as an example of the long-term planning and staff commitment that the Co-op Group has lacked – this month its record sales surpassed the latest UK sales figures for Marks & Spencer. There have also been far more recent successful transitions to employee ownership. In 1994 David Erdal, chairman of Glenrothes-based paper producer Tullis Russell, transferred the business to its workers because he thought it would function more effectively if they all had a stake. Employees own 7% of the shares directly but the bulk – 65% – are in an employee trust, with 28% in a charitable trust that gives more than £200,000 a year to local causes. Every year, a portion of profit is paid out in the form of shares to the employees, who each have an equal stake. The shares have a price determined by a formula based on financial performance but can only be traded in when the company's 476 workers, including 85 in South Korea, retire. Chris Parr, Tullis Russell's managing director, said: ""It is a powerful motivator for all the workforce. You work alongside each other and you both own the same number of shares. I can say to someone: 'If we redouble our efforts and productivity over the next 10 years, when we retire the share price will have gone up', and there's a huge benefit to that."" The day after the chancellor announced yet another plan to boost manufacturing and exports in last week's budget, the CBI reported a sharp drop in export orders, but Tullis Russell already sells almost three-quarters of its goods abroad. In the same year that Tullis Russell went mutual, Dick Philbrick founded Clansman Dynamics, an East Kilbride engineer that exports 95% of its ""manipulators"" – or manually operated robots – and other machinery used in foundries. In 2003, Philbrick sold a machine to the Mondragon cooperative – the huge manufacturing, retail and banking mutual in the Basque region of Spain – and was impressed by the motivation of its employees. In 2009, after buying out his fellow shareholders and taking advice from Tullis Russell's Erdal, Philbrick sold the business to his employees for £200,000. ""There has been a quite extraordinary change over the last four and a half years,"" he says. Staff meetings have become detailed inquisitions and discussions over pizza and Coke about the company's strategy. ""A fitter will say: 'Hey, why aren't we selling in Japan? Isn't it time we fixed that?' Sometimes it's not exactly comfortable. Managers don't like coming back to the next meeting without being able to report progress."" Since going mutual in the middle of the recession, Clansman has doubled its profits and hired 10 more staff, bringing the total to 40. There are other success stories, such as Dulas, based in Machynlleth, Wales. Its solar panels are mostly sold in the UK but a third of sales are solar medical fridges exported to emerging markets. All three businesses stress their ability to plan for the long term without City investors breathing down their necks. Philbrick says: ""I'm not impressed by rapid growth followed by rapid decline. Engineering companies need long-term decisions to get established. [At a plc,] if there is a drop in profits one quarter, it's treated as a mini-crisis."" Cooperatives span heavy industry to the creative sector. Two years ago Nick Sharpe founded Nifty Thinking in Leicester as a cooperative bringing freelance designers, copywriters, photographers and others working in branding under one roof. ""It means that as a freelancer, instead of working at home in your pants you can come together and work on bigger and better projects. There's always someone to bounce ideas off, we've got low overheads and we can produce fast turnarounds."" The movement will need such successes if it is to emerge from under the cloud of the Co-operative Group's troubles. Mayo says: ""I think it has created a question mark over the reputation of the cooperative model, which is not entirely fair. There are more than 6,000 cooperatives in very different markets, but in the public mind they don't necessarily see the differences between them. ""Public trust in the cooperative model is far higher than for business at large, but if one cooperative gets into trouble it can have an impact on all the others."""	Business
7592	7593	Tories must come clean on defence spending, says Nick Clegg 	 has said that the Conservative party has to “come clean” on defence spending, arguing that they cannot shrink the state and also “somehow pretend that they can fund everything in sight”. Speaking on Monday, the deputy prime minister said: “You cannot provide the British people with adequately resourced police forces, or an adequately resourced military forces if you take this ideological approach to reducing the amount of money that goes into public spending as a proportion of GDP for no economic reason at all.” “At some point, the Conservative party has got to come clean. They cannot have their cake and eat it. They cannot embark on this rightwing lurch towards an ever-shrinking state and also somehow pretend that they can fund everything in sight. You can’t. Something has to give.” The comments come as pressure builds on the Conservative party to commit to the Nato target of spending 2% of GDP on defence beyond 2016. , the Tory MP for Basildon and Billericay, John Baron, said that the Nato commitment should be seen as a bare minimum. Last week, the head of the US army, about the impact of cuts on the capacity of British forces. MPs are due to hold a backbench debate on defence spending on Thursday. David Cameron said on Monday hat the £160bn budget for defence equipment over the next 10 years would grow in real terms under a Conservative government and that he did not want to see any further reductions in the regular armed forces. The prime minister added: “I would say that you can’t have strong defence without a strong economy and we wouldn’t be able to make those pledges without the strong economy we now have.” Clegg stopped short of committing his own party to the defence spending target. “We spend just over 2% of GDP on defence presently,” he said. “What we spend in the future will obviously be subject to a strategic defence review and future spending rounds.” The deputy prime minister was speaking at a press conference alongside the business secretary, Vince Cable, where they set out Liberal Democrat plans to make the UK economy the “powerhouse of Europe”, overtaking France and Germany to become the biggest economy on the continent in a generation. Clegg said that the UK could have ended up in a similar situation to Greece if it had not been for the providing a stabilising influence in the coalition government. “When the Liberal Democrats took the decision to step up to the plate and enter government in May 2010, Britain’s economy was on the brink,” he said. “It may not feel like it now but we could have been Greece. In 2010, their deficit was 11% of GDP, ours was 10%. Britain desperately needed stability and the Liberal Democrats provided that by forming the only government capable of delivering it: a strong, stable coalition government.”	Politics
2810	2811	Plebgate: officers will not face disciplinary hearing despite criticism 	"Three police officers whose ""honesty and integrity"" have been questioned by the police watchdog will not face disciplinary action over allegations that they lied to try and discredit Andrew Mitchell at the height of the Plebgate affair. The officers, all Police Federation representatives, have been accused of misrepresenting what was said at a meeting they held last year with the then chief whip, following his altercation with two Downing Street diplomatic protection officers in which it was alleged he called them ""fucking plebs"". But it emerged on Tuesday that an investigation by their own forces into the allegations found there was no case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct, because their comments afterwards could at their strongest be seen as ""ambiguous or misleading"" but not deliberate lies. The IPCC has said it disagrees with the findings, and called on Tuesday for all three officers to face misconduct panels, saying the evidence indicated ""an issue of honesty and integrity"". Deborah Glass, deputy chair of the IPCC, said on Tuesday the officers should face disciplinary panels to decide whether they lied. it was ""quite wrong"" of West Mercia police not to take disciplinary proceedings against the three officers. May said: ""The IPCC statement makes troubling reading. If it is indeed the case that warranted police officers behaved in the way Deborah Glass has described, that's not acceptable at all."" She said West Mercia chief constable – who has now been summoned to give evidence to the Commons home affairs committee – should apologise to Mitchell. The IPCC – which allowed the three police forces to investigate their own officers – has no power in this case to force a disciplinary hearing as it only supervised the inquiry. Responding to the decision, Mitchell, who has been waiting more than a year for the outcome of investigations into police officers over allegations that they leaked information and conspired against him, said: ""It is a matter of deep concern that the police forces employing these officers have concluded that their conduct has not brought the police service into disrepute. Most people will disagree. ""It is a decision which will undermine confidence in the ability of the police to investigate misconduct when the reputation of the police service as a whole is at stake. ""My family and I have waited nearly a year for these police officers to be held to account and for an apology from the police forces involved. It seems we have waited in vain."" The officers, who were federation representatives from the West Mercia, West Midlands and Warwickshire forces, held a meeting with Mitchell last year in the aftermath of the Plebgate row. All three were at the forefront of the federation's anti-cuts campaign at the time. After the meeting, Ken Mackaill, chairman of the West Mercia federation, said Mitchell's position was untenable. He resigned a week later. But it was later alleged that they lied about what went on in the meeting – – in order to support their colleagues in London. They were accused of deliberately misrepresenting the meeting and calling Mitchell's integrity into question. Glass, deputy chair of the IPCC, said on Tuesday the officers should face disciplinary panels to decide whether they lied. ""In my view the evidence is such that a panel should determine whether the three officers gave a false account of the meeting in a deliberate attempt to support their MPS (Metropolitan police service) colleagues and discredit Mr Mitchell, in pursuit of a wider agenda. ""In my opinion the evidence indicates an issue of honesty and integrity, not merely naive or poor professional judgment,"" she said. Glass said she did not believe the officers could have been in any doubt about how their statements would have increased the pressure on Mitchell. ""As police officers they had a responsibility to present a fair and accurate picture. Their motive seems plain: they were running a successful, high-profile, anti-cuts campaign and the account that he provided to them did not fit with their agenda,"" she said. Glass said the IPCC did not have the power to direct its forces to carry out disciplinary action because Mitchell had not made a formal complaint. But had the IPCC decided to take on the inquiry as an independent investigation, it would have been able to force a misconduct panel to take place. In a statement Warwickshire, West Mercia and West Midlands police stood by their conclusions. ""Despite a thorough investigation under the supervision of the IPCC we do not believe that there is sufficient evidence to support the view that the officers concerned should face misconduct proceedings,"" the statement said. ""Our view is that the officers have demonstrated poor judgment in arranging and attending the meeting in the first place. In light of this, our position is that management action is a proportionate response."" The three forces added that had the IPCC decided to treat the investigation as a managed or an independent investigation it would have had the power to direct the forces to convene misconduct proceedings, but had chosen not to exercise these powers. The Crown Prosecution Service is considering a file of evidence from the Metropolitan police's investigation into the incident, the leaking of information to the media and misconduct issues in relation to the altercation. Keir Starmer, the director of public prosecutions, said at the weekend that prosecutors would come to a decision on whether any officers or members of the public should be charged ""as soon as we can""."

12749	12750	Babel 	here are some films that arrive here from the international festival circuit almost incandescent with self-importance. They hover into the cinema in a kind of floating trance at how challenging and moving they are. They are films with a profound reluctance to get over themselves. They look up at the sceptical observer with the saucer-eyed saintliness of a baby seal in culling season, or a charity mugger smilingly wishing a nice day on the retreating back of a passer-by. One such is Babel, the exasperatingly conceited new film from Alejandro González Iñárritu. It is well acted and handsomely photographed, but still extraordinarily overpraised and overblown, a middlebrow piece of near-nonsense: the kind of self-conscious arthouse cinema that is custom-tailored and machine-tooled for the dinner-party demographic. The script is contrived, shallow, unconvincing and rendered absurd and almost meaningless by a plot naivety that is impossible to ignore once its full magnitude dawns on you. Exactly like Amores Perros and 21 Grams - the previous movies of Iñárritu and his screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga - Babel is structured around a disparate group of characters yoked together by a quirk of fate. In those films, the quirk was respectively a car crash and a heart transplant, and just as in 21 Grams, we are here presented with fragments of lives and invited to guess how the jigsaw pieces fit together. This time it's a gun which joins everything up, an object passed from hand to hand. It is a Winchester hunting rifle which a shepherd in north Africa buys and (rashly) entrusts to his two young sons, telling them to shoot jackals that menace his flock. There are no prizes for guessing if something terrible happens. One tragic shot from this rifle is, as they say, heard around the world. The fate of the shepherd and his boys (Mohamed Akhzam, Boubker Ait El Caid and Said Tarchani) is now welded to that of a desperately unhappy American couple (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett); their terrible situation causes the lives of a brash Mexican guy and his respectable aunt (Gael García Bernal and Adriana Barraza) to go tragically off course and everyone is enigmatically connected to a Japanese widower and his hearing-impaired teenage daughter (Kôji Yakusho and Rinko Kikuchi). It is arguably bold and ambitious in its way, set in world of globally intuited emotional distress. The opening event is a butterfly's wingbeat that sends a ripple of anguish all over the planet. With one extravagant narrative flourish, Iñárittu and Arriaga seek to create a postmodern We-Are-the-World spectacle, uniting the prosperous nations with the developing ones in a kind of pain-continuum. Notably, however, it is the characters from the poor countries who really bear the brunt by the movie's finish, and it is difficult to see exactly how intentional this irony is. As the action intercuts between Morocco, Japan, Mexico and the United States, the connections become apparent, and as the truth dawns, so will your irritation and incredulity. It is when the Japanese link is explained that the plot hole opens up. Suffice it to say that a key piece simply doesn't fit. Despite self-consciously invoking the tough new post-9/11 world, in which international politics is coloured by fear and loathing of international terrorism, Babel is very naive about how easy it is to bring a dangerous firearm into a foreign country and then casually leave it behind as a present. Plenty of classic films have plot glitches, of course, but this one is pretty excessive. The movie's later sequences in the Californian desert verge on gratuitous miserablist agony, though neatly concluded with a laughably convenient stroke of luck. Babel's final scene is particularly suspect, involving tastefully softcore teen nudity, and the exploitative conflation of vulnerability and disability. In fact its final shot, pulling back from two figures at the balcony of an apartment building to show the whole city with all its twinkling lights - well, it gets very close to Richard Curtis territory, though Mr Curtis would not be so heavy-handed about it all. There are well-turned individual scenes, and it is never dull exactly. , whose gaunt, careworn appearance about the eyes has perhaps been cosmetically emphasised, gives a good performance, though Cate Blanchett has nothing much to do other than lie on the floor whimpering, and her prone position is emblematic of the passive agony underlying the movie's body language. Iñárritu has been such an exciting film-maker until now, but in simply repeating the narrative device, he looks like a one-trick pony and Babel has the unfortunate effect of retrospectively diminishing the value of his previous two films. It is less than the sum of its grandiose parts, while remaining bloated with its own euphoric spiritual pain.	Film
14220	14221	Ukip suspends Roger Bird after sexual harassment allegations 	The UK Independence party has suspended its general secretary in relation to alleged “impropriety”, after a female candidate accused him of sexually harassing her. Roger Bird, who has been a senior Ukip official since July, told the Guardian there were no criminal allegations involved. The claims have been made by Natasha Bolter, a former Labour supporter and rising star in the party who addressed its autumn conference and was hoping to be a candidate in Basildon, Essex. She told the Times that Bird, who was involved in vetting candidates, made unwanted advances to her on the day she was interviewed after taking her to London’s Oxford and Cambridge Club. She claimed that, on a second occasion, he called her for a meeting and bought her an expensive dress to wear to the same club before telling her that she “now looked like a girl who could get in a taxi”. She told the newspaper that he made further unwanted advances after a meal, which she again rejected. After this incident, Bolter claims to have received anonymous emails saying she had slept with Bird and “bullying” her, at which point she made a complaint to party officials. Bird said: “Natasha Bolter’s candidate assessment was conducted entirely within the rules as the party has already verified. “Subsequent to that, Natasha Bolter and I were in a consensual relationship. I am not the head of candidates and I do not dictate which candidates get selected for which seats, nor would I try to, although I have advised and helped a number of candidates over the course of my years in the party. “The party quite rightly has a duty to investigate complaints of a potentially serious nature and I feel they have acted entirely properly in doing that … It is important that the party has instigated a formal process and I hope that will soon be brought to a conclusion.” Ukip had earlier released a statement saying Bird had been suspended, while declining to go into details. It said: “Shortly after a claim came to light about the conduct of Mr Bird with regard to candidate selection, the UK Independence party took action swiftly and decisively, including steps involving external human resources consultants, as well as following due process and the party’s constitution to the letter. “Unfortunately, Ukip has had to suspend Mr Bird pending a full investigation into allegations made against him. The party has acted swiftly and decisively and will not tolerate impropriety of any kind amongst its staff.” Bird has previously held a role as chairman of Ukip in south-east England and was selected as a parliamentary candidate for the seat of Cities of London and Westminster last month. The party has recently been under scrutiny over the way some local candidates have been deselected potentially to make way for bigger names. Bird was involved in at least one of these controversies, as he told the Portsmouth News that the removal of Douglas Denny in Portsmouth South was a “routine event”. His LinkedIn page says he has been general secretary of the party since July 2014 and was previously a finance director and auditor. Ukip has previously suspended councillors for making controversial remarks about flooding being linked to gay marriage as well as racist and homophobic Facebook comments. Godfrey Bloom, the former Ukip MEP and frontbench spokesman, was also suspended last year over a series gaffes, including suggesting women were “sluts” for not cleaning behind the fridge and describing recipients of foreign aid as “bongo-bongo land”.

1924	1925	Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit – review 	"om Clancy's undercover CIA hombre Jack Ryan is given a sort of reboot-makeover in this moderate spy thriller, directed by , which feels cobbled together from every other action movie you can vaguely remember having seen. Ryan is a little bit more like Matt Damon's Jason Bourne, but also like Claire Danes's character in Homeland, less macho, more cerebral and analytical – he's faced with a creepy Homeland-type sleeper cell on US soil: it's not al-Qaida though, but an old-fashioned threat from the Russkies. plays Ryan, who patriotically joins the marines after 9/11, gets badly injured, falls for his beautiful physiotherapist (Keira Knightley, on familiar lips-slightly-parted form) and then gets recruited to the agency from civilian life by Kevin Costner who lumbers through this older-guy mentor role. The baddie is the chilling, thin-lipped Russian plutocrat Viktor Cherevin, played by Branagh himself with the traditional reedyiculous Ryussian accyent. He has one decent scene: a flirtatious dinner with Keira, where they talk about Lermontov, Russian romantic yearning and regret ""piling up around you like unread books"". Branagh needn't necessarily regret doing this film – though it's a bit silly and slightly dull."	Film
922	923	Centrica makes profit warning amid household bills controversy 	"British Gas owner has issued a profit warning as it admitted that investor confidence and public trust in the energy industry has been damaged by the storm over rising bills. The company said it was an unprecedented time for Britain's energy sector, amid public fury about sharp price hikes and if Labour wins the next election. Last month from 23 November, and similar rises have been announced by the rest of the ""big six"" power companies. Centrica said in a trading update on Thursday: ""Investor confidence has been damaged and there is increased uncertainty over investment in the energy infrastructure that the UK needs. ""Energy suppliers and politicians both have a role to play in helping to minimise the impact of higher costs on bills and improving transparency to restore trust in the industry."" In a warning on earnings, Centrica said market conditions remain ""challenging"", particularly in its business energy supply divisions in both Britain and the US, in UK gas-fired power generation and in UK gas storage. It said full-year profits in its British Gas business division were likely to be ""significantly lower"" than in 2012. As a result, the company said adjusted earnings per share were likely to be flat in the full year to 31 December, while analysts were forecasting 3-4% growth. ""Assuming normal weather conditions for the remainder of the year, we expect our residential energy supply margin to be slightly lower than last year, a little under 5% after tax,"" it added. British Gas supplied 15.7m households at the end of October, roughly the same as at the half-year stage, but the number of British Gas services accounts was slightly lower at 8.3m, reflecting ""pressures on household disposable income"". The company's margins are also under pressure in North America, where it has lost customers over the last six months."	Business
9984	9985	More than 50 Labour MPs to defy Jeremy Corbyn in vote on Syria 	At least 50 Labour MPs are prepared to defy by backing military action to protect civilians in Syria, it has emerged, as cross-party support grows for a new and comprehensive strategy to end the crisis. In a clear challenge to the leader’s authority, a group of MPs and peers is ready to work with Conservative colleagues to promote a three-pronged strategy in which military intervention by UK forces would complement fresh humanitarian and diplomatic initiatives. In a sign of increasing cross-party cooperation over Syria, Tory MP and former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell, and Labour MP Jo Cox, a former head of policy at Oxfam, have joined forces in support of the plan in an . Corbyn has consistently made it clear he is opposed to British military involvement in Syria. Although his close friend and shadow chancellor John McDonnell , it would be a huge blow to the leader’s authority if a vote was passed with the backing of a sizable number of Labour MPs. Before the launch by Cox of an all-party group on Syria in parliament on Tuesday, she and Mitchell say that the response of the international community to the crisis, through the UN, has been “woefully inadequate”. They call for more humanitarian support for refugees from both the UK government and EU, urgent diplomatic efforts to bring President Bashar al-Assad to the negotiating table, and military involvement which has “protection of civilians at the heart of the mission”. This could include the use of troops to protect , and enforce a “no-fly” or “no bombing zone” to prevent Assad launching further attacks on his own people, as well as moves to hit Islamic State in Syria. Mitchell and Cox write: “Some may think that a military component has no place in an ethical response to Syria. We completely disagree. It is not ethical to wish away the barrel bombs from the Syrian government when you have the capacity to stop them. The deaths and fear generated by these indiscriminate air attacks are the main drivers of the refugee crisis in Europe. Nor is it ethical to watch when villages are overrun by Isis fighters, who make sex slaves of children and slaughter their fellow Muslims, when we have the capability to hold them back.” Senior Labour sources say between 50 and 100 of their MPs – including several members of the shadow cabinet – would be ready to back British military action if its ultimate purpose was to protect civilians caught up in a growing humanitarian disaster, rather than merely to extend attacks on Isis into Syria. David Cameron, has indicated that a fresh vote on military action may be imminent. It is understood he has been told by Tory whips that the number of Conservative MPs who would oppose intervention would be in single figures, and more than outnumbered by the number of Labour MPs who would be prepared to back the move. On Monday in a Commons debate on Syria, Cox will say that Labour should not allow the experience of Iraq to blind it to the need to back the use of military force for humanitarian ends, as it did in Bosnia, Kosovo and Sierra Leone. She will argue that Cameron has for too long put the issue on the “too difficult” pile following his humiliation in 2013. John Woodcock, Labour MP for Barrow and Furness, who is joining the all-party parliamentary group, said that MPs must keep an open mind given the human suffering of the Syrian people and the resulting refugee crisis. “The bottom line is that the killing and the flight of civilians will go on unless the international community can create safe havens in Syria for terrified people who are still being bombed,” he said. “That may well mean greater involvement from air forces to sustain a no-fly zone and will certainly require an end to the hand-wringing over President Putin’s disgraceful deceit in bombing anti-Assad rebels rather than Daesh [Isis].” Shadow justice secretary Lord Falconer told the : “My position is that the government has to make a military case. There has to be good reason to be doing it, obviously it has to be legal, and we have to consider what the consequences are, including radicalisation here. On the basis that the proper case is made, I think it would be capable of support. But it has to be made and they have not yet done that.” Corbyn also faces challenges over austerity and immigration. Senior Labour MPs have privately called on him to support the immigration bill, which includes measures to prevent immigrants undercutting British workers. However, shadow home secretary Andy Burnham has insisted that the party will oppose the “kneejerk” bill. Meanwhile, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon is attacking Corbyn’s support for the fiscal charter, which will commit the government to delivering an overall surplus by 2019-20 and to running an overall budget surplus in “normal times”. She told the : “This week is a key test of Labour’s credentials under Jeremy Corbyn – and it is a test they dare not fail if they are to be taken remotely seriously as an opposition. “If Labour do not vote against the Tories’ spending proposals, all of their anti-austerity rhetoric will be exposed as empty bluster and will confirm the SNP as the only serious party of opposition in the Commons. “Jeremy Corbyn has been overruled by his senior colleagues on Trident, and he cannot allow that to happen on austerity too.”	Politics

At the meeting in a hangar in Luton, representatives of Haji-Ioannou are expected to outline reasons why Rake, a former senior accountant, should step down. The company has urged shareholders to back Rake and said it had assurances from seven institutional investors that they would vote against the resolution. It is the third extraordinary general meeting Haji-Ioannou has called in 11 months. in February, investors backed the chairman. Haji-Ioannou controls about 37% of the shares and also lost a vote on remuneration, although 44% of the votes were cast against the bonuses for senior management, including the chief executive, Carolyn McCall, a former head of Guardian Media Group. Turnout was high at the annual meeting when 87.5% shareholders cast their vote. Rake has been under increasing pressure from the easyJet founder since he became linked to the role of chairman at Barclays. Rake withdrew from the process of heading the troubled bank, prompting Haji-Ioannou to say: ""If he's not good enough for Barclays then he's certainly not good enough for easyJet. Our message going into next month's EGM is clear. We don't want any Barclays castoffs."" appointed Sir David Walker as chairman on Thursday; Rake remains deputy."	Business
9634	9635	Director Paul Thomas Anderson talks to Ed Pilkington 	"t is 10 years since first left audiences and critics dumbstruck and confounded with his breakthrough film Boogie Nights, when he was just 27. How could such a pipsqueak of a director, they asked back in 1997, create a masterpiece that wowed right from its opening sequence: an audacious five-minute tracking shot that swoops and swirls through the nightclub of the film's title in joyful synchronisation to the dance music of the 1970s. He has astonished ever since. Magnolia, the next out of the blocks, was an even bigger, more complex and yet richly evocative film that belied any attempt to categorise it. He was 31 by then, but still people marvelled at how one so young could conjure up such accomplished work. Anderson appeared to have found his style - the repertory film in which a multitude of characters and plot-lines are interwoven. But then in 2002 he bamboozled us again. He threw out the repertory technique and opted instead for a radically scaled-down and linear story in Punch-Drunk Love. It ran at a conventional 90 minutes - half the length of Magnolia - and though the film was anything but conventional, it left many fans delighted, others disappointed. This year we are seeing the release of his fifth feature, There Will Be Blood, and it feels like an important moment. At 37, he's no longer the precocious youth. He has proved himself to be a director of formidable imagination and ambition, but we're waiting to see what he will do with such gifts. Will he have the resources to amaze us one more time? It has to be said that the figure of the man sitting in front of me when we meet in a hotel in New York does not generate huge confidence. Others have remarked that PT Anderson in person looks weirdly fragile for such a titan of the cinema, but today he's beyond fragile. He is a wreck. He's unshaven. His brown shirt is more crumpled than linen fashionably should be. His posture is crumpled too. When later I play the tape of our conversation back, the first sound he makes that I hear him utter can roughly be transcribed as ""Ooooooh"" - a guttural, heartfelt expression of pain. But, to be fair, it is the morning after the premiere of There Will Be Blood and PTA is, by his own admittance, worse for wear. Even so he is swaddled in an almost visible happy glow. The previous night, he tells me, represented the fulfilment of a childhood dream: to have his film shown at the New York Ziegfeld cinema. ""I'd always wanted it, dreamed about it. It's a palace, a great old movie palace. I dare say we won't be making a big oil epic any time in the future and you think, 'Fuck! Hopefully it can play in a place like that.' It was massive, and we turned it up real loud."" What he describes as his ""big oil epic"" has been making waves even before it opened in America on Boxing Day. The LA Film Critics Association gave it four awards including best picture and director, and it has been nominated for two Golden Globes. Not bad going, I say, in an attempt to cheer up the suffering figure before me. ""Yeah, you get it into your head that they don't matter, but then they give these awards to you and you love it,"" he says. The inspiration for There Will Be Blood came to him a few years ago when he was in London. He says he had been feeling homesick for California's San Fernando Valley where he grew up and which famously forms the backdrop to all his earlier films. He had started writing a script about two warring families - a conceit that he liked, but he was struggling to know how to develop the story. He was browsing in a bookshop in Covent Garden when he saw a book with the word Oil! in bright red letters on the cover. It was the 1927 novel by Upton Sinclair set in California at the turn of the century among oil prospectors scrambling to buy up the fields. It rang instant bells with him; not only as a piece of his own local history, but as a perfect backdrop to his story about fighting families. The result is a film that certainly does amaze, and bears several of the PTA hallmarks: breathtaking confidence, a love of acting and of visual beauty, and an exceptional grasp of the art of storytelling. Yet it confounds too, though Anderson, ever the director to avoid pigeon-holing, dislikes the description of the film as a departure. ""Oh, fuck, no!"" he says. (There are a lot of four letter words in the course of a PTA conversation, you just have to accept that.) ""Don't depart just yet! There's nothing worse than somebody saying I want to do something that's a departure."" One of the most obvious contrasts with his earlier films, apart from its glorious outdoors setting in the open desert of Texas (California is too concreted over to provide its own setting), is that There Will Be Blood is more overtly engaged with politics than his previous films. I ask him how could a movie centred on the clash between an oil prospector's desire to make it rich and a evangelical pastor's spiritual attempts to stop him be anything else? ""Of course, I'm no dummy,"" he says with a slight warning growl. ""But there's a trap you can fall into. If you set out to make a movie about oil and religion I'm not sure you wouldn't crash the car. Fuck! It's a movie first. You have to put on a good show first, I think."" At the centre of his efforts to put on a good show is the mesmerising performance of , whose tour-de-force portrayal of the rags-to-riches oil man, Daniel Plainview, has to put him in the running for an Oscar. Day-Lewis conjures up a character of primeval energy, driven by greed and hunger for power, yet capable of tenderness as well as brutality. Anderson heightens the effect by letting the camera linger on the actor long beyond the point that most directors would shout ""Cut!"" The opening of the film is even more audacious than Boogie Nights - for the first 15 minutes or so, no word is spoken as we watch Day-Lewis frantically dig his mine shafts, his face blackened as though he were sweating oil. I ask Anderson what it was like working so intimately with one actor - an experience quite at contrast with the ensemble approach with which he made his name. ""At best it feels that you are connected to each other. You are completely playing the same tune. There's this kind of line between myself and the camera and Daniel that's pulled tight. When it was going well it felt just like that. ""We're still trying to figure out who the girlfriend is and who the boyfriend is in this relationship. When we first met I called him a few days later and I left a message saying: 'It's your girlfriend.' It feels like that. You are in a relationship with someone so intimate, every single day. I dare say there were moments when our spouses were jealous."" There is a good deal of classic American cinema in There Will Be Blood, partly perhaps as a result of the fact that Anderson compulsively played and replayed John Huston's 1948 gem, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, as he was writing the script. He set himself the challenge of attempting to make a film as simple and direct as that, saying to me that he felt that in his previous films he had never quite managed to achieve economy in storytelling. ""Tell the story! Tell the story! That's what I saw in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. The films that I love are very straightforward stories, like really old-fashioned stuff. I've never been a fan of whimsical or confusing storytelling."" With There Will Be Blood, he says, ""it was such a great feeling - cutting things out, slashing away. I didn't have any desire I might have had 10 years ago to shoot every single word that I wrote."" That ability - to slash away - comes with experience and growing confidence, I suggest, and he responds eagerly: ""I think so, yeah. That's definitely what it is. You feel more comfortable in your own skin and learn that omitting things is the same as writing things."" Before we end I tell him I feel duty bound to ask him who he wants to work with next, because when the Guardian asked him the same question in 2000 he uncannily replied: Adam Sandler and Daniel Day-Lewis. Would he stare into his crystal ball for us one more time? ""I'd like to work with Daniel Day-Lewis again,"" he says, forcing me to tell him that's not allowed. On his second attempt he says: ""I'd love to work with Phil [Seymour] Hoffman again, and at some point Robert De Niro. That's as good as they get, right?"" And what kind of film does he have in mind? Has he another itch that he needs to scratch? ""I'm already scratching,"" he replies. ""I'm thinking: 'That's enough of that, get back to work! Let's go!'"" There Will Be Blood is released on February 8"	Film
7094	7095	Ed Sheeran talks Spotify royalties: 'I'm in the music industry to play live...' 	Artists including Thom Yorke, David Byrne and The Black Keys have criticised streaming music services like over the size of the royalties that musicians are paid for streams of their songs. isn’t joining their ranks, despite having been on the end of a single-figure Spotify royalty cheque earlier in his career. Sheeran played a short set and answered questions from fans at Amazon’s London office earlier today, and fielded a question about his views on digital music, and his policy of making his songs available to stream as soon as they go on sale. “I’m in the music industry to play live. That’s why I make records, that’s why i do radio interviews, that’s why i do Amazon events, that’s why I put things on Spotify. having recorded music is fantastic, but playing live is where I buzz the most,” he said. Sheeran is on the promotional trail for his latest album X, for which his label Atlantic Records has been running a marketing campaign taking in exclusive elements for iTunes, Spotify, YouTube and Facebook, as well as an “interactive” TV advert where viewers voted (via Twitter) on which song he should play in a commercial break. X was released to stream or buy on the same day, unlike recently windowed albums from artists including Coldplay, Beyoncé and Taylor Swift. Sheeran is firmly behind the on-sale on-stream policy. “This album was streamed 26 million times in the first week on Spotify, and that means 26 million people have heard my album,” he said, although given the likelihood that many fans listened more than once, that number may be a bit high. “That means a tenth of them might consider buying a ticket or going to a festival, and that’s enough for me to tour very comfortably.” Sheeran didn’t duck the issue of artists criticising Spotify for its royalties. The company pays out 70% of its revenues as royalty payments to labels and publishers, and has said that its average “per-stream” rate is between $0.006 and $0.0084. “I know a lot of artists are a bit iffy about it, and to be honest, I did get a royalty cheque from Spotify that was about £4,” said Sheeran. “It’s one of those things, but for me, the more iPods, phones and computers that I’m on, the better, because I just want to play. That’s what I enjoy.” That £4 cheque is likely to have come a lot earlier in Sheeran’s career. Spotify’s public song-play stats show that X has so far generated more than 433m streams on Spotify, while his previous album + has notched up more than 435m. That’s a total payout of more than $6.2m to his label and publisher from those two albums alone, although how much of that Sheeran earns will depend on his contract terms and songwriting credits. All this, and he doesn’t have to pay for his own phone. “Apple gave me an iPhone 6 yesterday because I played the iTunes Festival,” he told fans at the Amazon event. “Has it bent yet? Not yet. I haven’t tried to bend it though...” 	Technology
9297	9298	Cannes and Hollywood: a feisty marriage 	"In among the ligging and rigging of last year's Cannes film festival, visitors may have spotted and Alec Baldwin trudging wearily back and forth along the Croisette. The director and star, it now transpires, were in town to shoot a very meta documentary – a film about their efforts to actually make a film. For a 10-day spell they interviewed everyone from Ryan Gosling to Martin Scorsese, Nicole Kidman to Roman Polanski. Along the way they took the temperature of a festival perched at the intersection between art and commerce. The documentary's title, , alludes to Baldwin's description of the film industry as ""the world's worst girlfriend"". But it might just as easily refer to Cannes' teasing, tricky relationship with the major US studios. In this case, however, it's hard to tell just who is seducing who. On the eve of the 66th Cannes film festival, the romance is clearly in full bloom, with Warner Bros' star-spangled installed as the opening gala, Steven Spielberg booked as jury president, and the schedule awash with studio produce. But is this union as harmonious at it looks? A cynic could argue that all ostensibly happy marriages are really power struggles in disguise. If so, the alliance between Cannes and Hollywood is surely no exception. ""Cannes has always been a useful idiot for Hollywood,"" explains Toback, rasping down the line from his apartment in New York. ""And the studios, in turn, are a useful tool for Cannes. It's a symbiotic relationship. But I think it's more Cannes that courts the studios than the other way around."" This courtship has not been without its hiccups. As is the way with most romances, the early years proved the most golden. There were eight American films in the inaugural festival of 1946, including Billy Wilder's The Lost Weekend, Alfred Hitchcock's and a . Delbert Mann's blue-collar lifted the Palme d'Or in 1955, while fragrant Olivia de Havilland was the first American jury president in 1965. Throughout the 1970s, Cannes became a kind of Mecca for the best of US cinema, with , , and ascending to the winner's rostrum. In those halcyon days, it was possible to believe that Cannes and Hollywood were largely singing from the same hymn sheet. So what went wrong? Evidence suggests that studios cooled on Cannes during the blockbuster 1980s. All at once the festival did not fit with their business model. Executives baulked at the reputed $5m price tag of bringing a film to the Côte d'Azur. And by century's end, the marriage had all but run aground. ""Mainstream Hollywood is virtually absent from Cannes,"" festival president . ""Because the gap has widened between art and business, between popcorn pictures and arty films."" The studios, he added, would consent to send a film to the festival only after its run at US cinemas was safely over. ""They don't want to risk bad reviews in Europe."" Nick James, editor of Sight and Sound, remembers the Hollywood famine of the late 1990s. ""Lots of heavy European arthouse,"" he sighs. ""Lots of black-and-white pictures. Lots of four-hour movies."" James credits Thierry Frémaux, the current artistic director, with dragging Cannes back to a more even keel. On taking the reins in 2001, Frémaux has said that his first order of business was to re-establish ties with the Hollywood suits, adapting his festival to a new world order. ""Under his tenure you've seen the studios come in, animation come in, 3D come in. And I think it's worked; it's shaken things up,"" he says. ""It makes the programme more varied and exciting."" There's no doubt that this year's competition boasts an imposing Hollywood pedigree. Alexander Payne's may be shot in black and white, but it comes backed by Paramount. The Coen brothers' is a CBS film, while Steven Soderbergh's was commissioned by HBO. and are both Weinstein productions, with a third ( ) in the neighbouring Un Certain Regard sidebar. Added to this is Cannes' newfound habit of scheduling popcorn blockbusters in high-profile ""out of competition"" slots. In recent years, the Croisette has played host to The Matrix sequels and the Star Wars franchise, Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean. On such occasions, one has the distinct sense of a festival simultaneously basking in the limelight while wearing a clothes peg on its nose. Has the balance now swung too far? After all, doesn't Cannes pride itself on offering the finest, most challenging pictures from the world's four corners? Casting an eye over this year's lineup, the LA Times identified the pitfall, suggesting that ""US studio films run the risk of tipping the festival away from its independent roots"". Then there is the fact that the lavish opening premiere isn't really a premiere at all. Gatsby opened (to mixed reviews) in the US last week. Steven Gaydos, executive editor at Variety, concedes that this is a problem. ""It's certainly not great for Cannes that Gatsby does not premiere there,"" he says. ""But, for whatever reason, those are the terms the festival agreed to."" Yet, by and large, the marriage still works. ""I would describe the relationship as cautiously beneficial,"" Gaydos explains. ""Friends with dangerous benefits, and the danger lies in both directions. If you cater too much to the big studios, the big movie stars, then you risk losing your credibility and leave the other directors feeling overshadowed. But the hard fact is that festivals need stars. Nobody takes pictures of a festival without stars. That's the nature of the business."" For its part, Hollywood is still spooked by the consequences of launching in Cannes. ""The studios are nervous of having their films in competition, of having a negative judgment passed down upon them. They don't want to spend all this money coming to Europe, only to have their butts kicked by a bunch of snooty critics."" This, he adds, is what happened with , which opened the party back in 2006. "" ,"" Gaydos chuckles. ""They all but accused the film of starting world war two and kidnapping the Lindbergh baby. But so what? It still went on to make three-quarters of a billion dollars."" Back in New York, James Toback has a Cannes award for , plus a vaulted list of credits that extend from through to three collaborations with Robert Downey Jr. Even so, he has never strayed remotely close to a billion-dollar gross, and his latest feature is still stuck in development. Shooting his Cannes documentary, he says, has given him a clear-eyed sense of the industry today. ""If I can draw a conclusion other than we're all gonna die, I'd say that film is in a state of chaotic flux,"" Toback tells me. ""For an independent film-maker the only way to survive is to navigate your way through treacherous waters – or, to put it more cynically, to scheme and rob to stay afloat. Meanwhile, the studio system has gone to decision by committee. We have this endlessly watered-down, conglomerate world that breeds homicidal rage like no other."" He sighs. ""If I don't murder someone with an axe, I may make another film."" Seduced and Abandoned ushered Toback through the various levels of the Cannes Palais, ""from the engine room to the sky lounge"". What he found there may not have been pretty. And yet, despite all the heartache, he feels that the festival remains more saint than sinner. ""I'm not sure I agree with the people who criticise Cannes for selling out and say the place has become a circus,"" he says. ""That strikes me as pretty naive. Without all the studio money, the festival would not exist. The big films support the little films, and that's the way it works. Cannes is great because it's half and half, just as film itself is half and half, the art and the commerce. You can't make the movies without playing both sides."" And the winner of the award for best film at this year's Cannes goes to … whatever it was you didn't see. Three years ago, wailing could be heard in newsrooms the world over as Apichatpong Weerasethakul's took top honours. After a couple of years of winners ( , ) from directors with both name recognition and modest commercial prospects, we're due another winner that comes with three different types of subtitles, screened that morning of the tight deadline and the accidental hangover. The smart money at this stage is on . Michael Douglas has this in the bag already. Not only is his performance in the Liberace biopic reportedly incredible, the film has other assets that make it catnip for the jury. First off, there's the Euro-friendly explicitness: this really is no-holds-barred stuff, such as a scene that has the pianist watching porn with his puppy. But the real deal-sealer is that by rewarding Steven Soderbergh's film, Cannes would get one over on Hollywood, whose studios turned the script down for fear it was . HBO stepped in, meaning the film will premiere on TV in the US, and so be ineligible for the Oscars. Last year Marion Cotillard's turn in Jacques Audiard's , as a waterpark trainer who loses her legs, was beaten to the best actress award by two troubled nuns in Romanian drama Beyond the Hills. This year, Cotillard takes a belt-and-braces approach: she's an Ellis Island burlesque dancer in James Gray's 1920s-set , as well as a moll in 70s Brooklyn in (scripted by Gray, shot by her husband, Guillaume Canet). Only the first plays in competition, but impetus will be strong to reward a woman many still feel was robbed. In 2011, Sean Penn's Robert Smith-alike in the Paulo Sorrentino drama got tongues wagging and heads shaking. This year, all eyes are on Tom Hiddleston , who plays an undead underground muso in Jim Jarmusch's crypto-vampire romance . Advance photos show leather jackets and long black locks. Michel Hazanavicius's homage to the silents then the following February. This year we've one idiosyncratically monochrome movie – Alexander Payne's father/son road trip, – and one entirely speech-free offering:  , JC Chandor's followup to , this time with sole cast member Robert Redford up some sort of creek without a paddle.

8305	8306	Labour MPs seek to make a 'memento toffee' out of Andrew Mitchell 	"The Commons had its first chance to discuss the revelations of appalling behaviour of a once highly respected and admired public figure, whose name has over the past few weeks become synonymous with abuse. MPs also talked about Jimmy Savile. But there are no votes in his crimes, so they were happy – at least Labour MPs were happy – to talk about first. The chief whip, who is due to account for himself to leaders of the Tories' 1922 Committee, sat in his place at the end of the front bench. He looked, if that is possible, even more like a very stern codfish who has been on the slab for too long. For most of the time he stared straight ahead while various Home Office ministers sort of defended him. MPs were performing a delicate balancing act. They want to remind the voters about what Mr Mitchell may or may not have shouted at the police as often as possible. In the jargon, it fits in with their ""narrative"", which is that the government is composed of arrogant toffs (another word, like ""pleb"" which you almost never hear in real life) who despise mere public servants. At the same time, they want him to stay, a permanent reminder of the narrative, a sort of ""memento toffee"" as the Roman plebs might have said. At first the job of reviling Mr Mitchell was left to backbenchers – all female, for some reason that eludes me. Catherine McKinnell asked what the effect would be on police morale of a ""cabinet minister verbally abusing"" officers. Damian Green said crisply that Mr Mitchell had apologised to the officer, the officer had accepted it, ""and for most people that would be enough"". Barbara Keeley chipped in. She accused the chief whip of ""ranting and raving."" Theresa May, the home secretary, said that this matter had been dealt with, ""and that is an end to it."" This fell somewhat short of a stout defence, and a look of slight anxiety crossed Mr Mitchell's fishy face, as if he had spotted a waiter arriving with a jug of Mornay sauce. At this stage we assumed that Labour was leaving the job to the troops while the officers kept quiet. But suddenly Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, was up, quoting Theresa May back at her. She had told the Police Federation that she believed the public should always give them the respect they deserved. Her implication was clear. ""I have already answered that question,"" said Mrs May. ""No you haven't!"" Labour members bellowed back. Seema Malhotra said that in her constituency people were arrested for abusing the police. Did this mean a different law applied in Whitehall? ""No,"" said Mrs May, looking increasingly unhappy. The session ended and Mr Mitchell disappeared. We were on to Jimmy Savile. Whatever you think about his loathsome attacks, there is something faintly distasteful about the hunting mentality of some MPs. They want him stripped of his knighthood and OBE, even though those died with him. I half-expected someone to demand that the wretched man be dug up so that furious crowds could tear to pieces whatever is left of him."	Politics

Spurs took the as Andre Villas-Boas's successor on Monday. The 44-year-old has no experience of first-team management but he was selected ahead of the likes of the Holland manager, Louis van Gaal. Sherwood played for Tottenham for four years and he has been part of the coaching set-up since 2008. He hopes his connection with the club will help him. Sherwood, speaking for the first time since he signed an 18-month contract, told Spurs TV: ""It's an honour to be head coach of this top club. It's a club that means an awful lot to me and a proud moment. ""If you cut me in half, I bleed the colour of the club. It means an awful lot to me. Blood is thicker than water, as they say.

363	364	Bomb threats made on Twitter to female journalists 	"Police are investigating bomb threats made on against several female journalists, including Guardian columnist Hadley Freeman. At 5.50pm on Wednesday Freeman received a tweet from an anonymous user, @98JU98U989, which claimed that a bomb had been placed outside her home and would be detonated at 10.47pm. She reported it to the Metropolitan police, who told her they were launching an investigation as the threat was an arrestable offence. The police also advised her not to stay at home overnight. Grace Dent, a columnist for the Independent and former Guardian writer, received the same message as Freeman, which . It states: ""A BOMB HAS BEEN PLACED OUTSIDE YOUR HOME. IT WILL GO OFF AT EXACTLY 10.47PM ON A TIMER AND TRIGGER DESTROYING EVERYTHING."" Although the user's account was suspended, several other women – including Catherine Mayer, Europe editor of Time magazine, Sara Lang, a social media manager at American non-profit AARP, and Anna Leszkiewicz, editor of Cherwell, Oxford University's independent student newspaper – subsequently received identical threats. The bomb threats come just days after . Police investigating allegations of harassment against the two women on the website : a 25-year-old man in north-east England and a 21-year-old in the Manchester area. Freeman said the police who interviewed her about the bomb threat asked whether she was friends with Criado-Perez. Freeman, whose latest column addressed the issue of misogynistic online abuse, said: ""I get loads of abuse on Twitter. That I should just 'go back to the kitchen', or someone saying they can't wait until women lose the vote. ""It's not all from men, some are clearly from women, such as ""I'm only a feminist because I can't get a boyfriend, or I must be a lesbian because I'm a feminist. I have had some rape threats too. They're always misspelled."" She said the abuse directed against her had become more angry, intense and misogynistic since the threats against Criado-Perez and Creasy. ""Because of the bomb threat this time I called the police. There was that guy arrested for threatening to blow up an airport. If it's illegal to threaten to bomb an airport, it's illegal to threaten to bomb me."" Freeman said the police had also advised anyone who received a similar threat to report it. Twitter bosses are to be questioned by MPs about complaints that they have failed to do enough to protect women from users posting violent and abusive threats. Freeman said Twitter needs to take online abuse and threats more seriously and should introduce more robust ways to deal with them. ""Threatening to bomb and rape people is illegal. We need to apply the law in the same way online as we do in the real world. There should be a button to report abuse more easily. Twitter makes money – they can afford some moderators."" Another woman targeted with the message, Katie Hartwill, parliamentary assistant to Tory MP Chloe Smith, said: ""Twitter has a moral obligation to do all it can to protect its users from abuse and threats on its platform. But ultimately this is not simply trolling, death threats are a crime and should be recognised as such."" Del Harvey, Twitter's director for trust and safety, admitted it was not the company's policy to automatically report threatening or abusive messages to police. The website does not hold information to reveal the location a message has been sent from and therefore cannot identify the correct local police force, Harvey said. She also revealed she had received messages threatening to rape her on ""multiple platforms across multiple sites on the internet"", but chose not to prosecute. Harvey told BBC Radio Five Live: ""We don't have that much information about our users compared with other platforms. ""We don't always have that information about where the message came from. ""If somebody called you and said, 'I'm going to come over and beat you up', you don't expect the phone company to contact the police. You certainly expect them to work with police."" The Metropolitan police confirmed they had received ""allegations relating to bomb threats sent to a number of females on Twitter"". No arrest has been made but inquiries continue."	Technology
4709	4710	David Moyes accepts responsibility for Manchester United's poor run 	"David Moyes has said he will take the blame for Manchester United's erratic results in his first season as manager, describing it as a ""tough"" introduction to life after and admitting the team need to improve in every department. That process will begin in the Champions League on Tuesday night, with United needing a draw against to win a qualifying group that has passed smoothly compared with the chequered performances that have left them ninth in the Premier League, 13 points off Arsenal at the top. After losing at home to Newcastle for the first time since 1972, on the back of Everton's first win at Old Trafford since 1992, United are in danger of chalking up three successive defeats on their own ground in the space of six days. The last time they went down three times in a row at Old Trafford was in the 1962-63 season when they finished 19th, their lowest position with Matt Busby as manager. Moyes said his players were ""hurting"" and Ferguson's successor accepted his results were not good enough for a club with United's ambitions. ""I take complete responsibility for the results. Fortunately they have been good in the but they have not been good in the Premier League, so I take responsibility for them as well. I would like them to be much better and I have no doubt they will be. ""The biggest transition is that a manager who was here for 26 years has moved on and a new manager has come in, so it is a transitional period for the whole football club, not just for me and the players. ""We've been inconsistent at times, we've played very well in some of the games in the Champions League, not so well in the Premier League, albeit we've lacked a little bit of good fortune in one or two games which might have made a difference."" He added: ""I think it's a bit of everything we could do better. We would like to play better generally, we would like to pass it better, we would like to create more chances and to defend better when those moments arrive, so I think it's all around we're trying to improve. But it was only a few weeks ago when we had beaten Arsenal and Leverkusen, and we were talking very well about the team."" Moyes was asked how he was coping with the intense spotlight that always accompanies a run of bad results for United. ""It is tough because the expectancy is to win all the games. The players are hurting. They're used to winning and when they don't win that hurts them. They care very much about the team and the club. They are good lads and they will respond in the right way. There will be no doubt about that."" Moyes was accompanied as he spoke by Rafael da Silva, the team's right-back. ""Of course it hurts,"" the Brazilian said. ""As a United player I want to win every single game. We must work more and improve ourselves."" United qualified for the knockout phase of the Champions League after the 5-0 thrashing of Bayer Leverkusen in Germany, a performance that illustrates Moyes's point about their inconsistency, coming during a run of four Premier League games that have yielded only two points.There are, however, obvious benefits to ensuring they maintain their place at the top of Group A, bearing in mind the winners all avoid each other in the next round. Barcelona, Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Atlético Madrid have ensured they will be in that part of the draw. Bayern Munich will almost certainly join them and that brings a clear edge to the Donetsk game. A win for the Ukrainian side would mean United finishing as runners-up. ""It's important to give ourselves the best possible chance in the next round,"" Moyes said. ""The big job was to make sure we qualified. We have done that and hopefully we can finish off the group unbeaten. If we do that, that will see us through."" The manager accepted, though, that his team need to show more belief and conviction. ""In recent games we haven't quite finished the games the way we would have liked to,"" he said. ""We have tried to make changes to improve things but it hasn't quite happened."""	Football
7753	7754	Passport Office orders inquiry over photographs leaked to Guardian 	"The has ordered an inquiry into photographs leaked to the Guardian which showed hundreds of files, full of passport applications, stacked in a room usually used for meetings. The move, which could lead to disciplinary action, has been described as heavy-handed, a waste of money and against the public interest by MPs and union officials. Photographs, taken in a conference room in the Passport Office centre in Liverpool, were published as the agency's chief executive, Paul Pugh, was denying there was a backlog of cases. A day after their publication, David Cameron admitted for the first time that there was a problem in the Passport Office. Theresa May, the home secretary, on Thursday , which the government puts at 30,000 ""straightforward"" applications. Andy Bannon, the security liaison officer, on Wednesday saying: ""I am sure everyone is now aware of the photographs of the temporary storage facility on the second floor that were leaked to the press yesterday. ""This is being viewed as a serious security breach and I have notified the internal investigations team accordingly. They will be making a full investigation and if there is clear evidence linking a member of HMPO, Steria or our contracted staff to the breach, formal misconduct procedures will be considered,"" he wrote. ""Whatever the motives behind the leak, there does not appear to be any recognition of the impact this has had on colleagues working exceptionally hard to manage the unprecedented levels of demand currently being experienced."" He added that any further security breaches could result in a blanket ban on mobile phones on the premises. John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw, said the person who took the photographs should be congratulated by the Passport Office because their actions had revealed the extent of problems that were being denied. ""Over the last few weeks I have had to intervene to get a 90-year-old war veteran a passport so he could get to the D-day celebrations after the Passport Office failed to process his application. Children in my constituency have missed their school trips because of this mess. ""The hero who took these photos has offered my constituents and millions of others hope that this shambles might not continue. Instead of wasting resources chasing a genuine whistleblower, the Passport Office should spend their time and money getting people their passports,"" he said. Mark Serwotka, the head of the PCS union whose members represent staff in Britain's seven Passport Office centres, said the move was heavy-handed and against the public interest. ""This is a ludicrously over-the-top response from the Passport Office and will do nothing to restore the goodwill that has been lost in recent days and weeks, as officials and ministers have sought to cover up the extent of the problems caused by a chronic shortage of staff. ""Arguably if it wasn't for those photographs, we wouldn't have had the debate in the Commons today and there was clearly an overwhelming public interest in publishing them,"" he said. The photographs show hundreds of boxes of orange and white files stacked on tables. A source close to the Liverpool office said there were 15 to 20 applications in each box, and that the orange boxes were overseas applications while the white boxes showed those from the UK. The room is usually used for meetings and induction sessions and is usually partitioned into two, the source said. It was not used to store application files during the peak period last year and had not been used before for this purpose. Two other meeting rooms on the first floor of the building and another second-floor meeting room were also being used to store applications waiting to be processed, said the source. Insiders said this was the first time the room had been used to store files of applications, forcing them to hold meetings in a stationery cupboard. A Home Office spokesman said the department would not comment on a leaked document."	Politics
7161	7162	Elysium director Neill Blomkamp: 'You'd have to change the human genome to stop wealth discrepancy' 	"eill Blomkamp has a vision of 2154, and it's not good news. His prognosis finds Earth in a sorry state: the whole world has become the third world, with the extremely wealthy 1% abandoning our ravaged planet for , a luxurious space station. Earth is a giant slum, a totalitarian nightmare in which citizens live like rats with Elysium glowing above them, like ""Bel Air in space,"" says Blomkamp. To underline the yawning chasm between the haves and have-nots of his future dystopia, Blomkamp decided that the only contemporary location that could accurately convey the grimness of life on Earth in the 22nd century was the world's second-biggest garbage dump, in Mexico City. But when he and his crew actually turned up to the Bordo Poniente landfill, he began to regret his decision. ""It was pretty goddamn terrible,"" he laughs, now safely ensconced in a London hotel suite. ""There were a lot of production people trying to put me off that location. The Canadian unions got involved; they wanted toxicology reports because they were concerned about their members. So we got approval. Then a few months later, day one of the dump, we were driving into it at dawn, and the smell went inside the car. And quietly I was thinking I might have bitten off more than I could chew. It was like: 'Holy shit. I don't know if I can do this for two weeks.' But it looks rad, right?"" It does. One of the key features of the original is that its worlds aren't perfect: they have a lived-in quality. Elysium runs with that idea, its bleak future Earth looking less lived-in than royally shat on. ""Battered,"" agrees Blomkamp. ""Fucked up. Hammered on. I love that, though. It makes it feel real. My main thing is realism."" Elysium is only his second feature after the sublimely bizarre , but all of Blomkamp's work, including his short films and commercials (remember Citroën's dancing Transformer?) have a singular voice. In his worlds, robots and aliens mix with humans, high-tech body-modification is rife, and society is screwed. The seeds of this vision were sown in his youth. He grew up in apartheid-era Johannesburg and fell for sci-fi early, notably and its sequel. By 14, he was a computer graphics whizz kid; at 17, he and his family, fleeing the violence of their homeland, emigrated to Canada, where he became a visual effects artist. His short film Alive In Joburg caught the attention of , who hired him for a film adaptation of the videogame, but corporate politics nixed the project. It was a blessing in disguise, says Blomkamp: the day after Halo folded, Jackson encouraged him to forge ahead with his own film, District 9, which told of ghettoised aliens and corrupt bureaucracy, and was a critical and commercial banger, celebrated for its sci-fi japes as well as its political allegory. Suddenly, all of Hollywood wanted him, but he didn't bite. ""I actually didn't go to a lot of the meetings. District 9 was very difficult to make, but I knew it was a film I would love to watch. And I wanted to hang on to that feeling. I started remembering what happened on Halo. Just the fact that they refer to stories as IP – intellectual property – is fucking terrifying. Any discussions that begin: 'Neill should look at this piece of IP', I can't even go to that meeting. So I really didn't engage with anything. Although when MGM was starting to do , I was like, 'Fuck me, that film would be awesome to redo.' It's one of my favourite films of all time, it struck so close to home. But then I thought: 'Well, Paul Verhoeven already did it and it was awesome.'"" His integrity intact, Blomkamp moved on. Elysium may be set in the future, but it's merely an amplification of an age-old problem. ""The issues raised by Elysium have been in existence as long as homo sapiens,"" he argues. ""You'd literally have to change the human genome to stop wealth discrepancy. But it's happening now on a globalised level. The outsourcing of whatever you need done, at low cost, can happen in a different country; you don't even need to know about it any more."" brings all of this into the multiplex, and the film's substantial thrills and spills don't disguise Blomkamp's glum outlook. ""That's good, that's what I wanted people to think,"" he says. ""We have biological systems built into us that were very advantageous for us, up until we became a functioning civilisation 10,000 years ago. We are literally genetically coded to preserve life, procreate and get food – and that's not gonna change. The question is whether you can somehow overpower certain parts of that mammalian DNA and try to give some of your money out, try to take your wealth and pour it out for the rest of the planet."" Watching Elysium, it's apparent he thinks the human race is probably buggered, although the solution he's holding out for is reassuringly Blomkampian. ""The only way things will change is if we're smart enough to develop technology that can think us out of this, meaning augmenting ourselves genetically to be smart enough to change shit,"" he says. ""Or to have artificial intelligence and programs to help solve the problems."" Given his South African upbringing, divisions infuse Blomkamp's work. Like District 9, Elysium deals with segregation, although this time the metaphor is not racial but financial. He believes the increase in population and decrease in resources means the whole planet will become one big Johannesburg of fortified communities nestling next to slums. ""Then we'll go beyond that timeline,"" he says, ""and it'll either be a singularity discussion or this Mad Max fuckin' group of savages roaming on the horizon, a Malthusian catastrophe."" Elysium is brimming with macro and micro metaphor. The film's intransigent robot parole officer was inspired by Blomkamp's experiences with automated bureaucracy (""I'll actually huck the phone across the room trying to deal with a bank""); a nasty radiation incident has parallels with developing-world labour (specifically, he says, the Bangladesh textile industry); while the totalitarian slumland was inspired by his own 2005 arrest by cops on the bribe in Tijuana. He is, however, eager to stress he doesn't believe films can bring about societal change. He's not dishing out messages, he says, but observations, entrenched in popcorn thrill-rides. Just as District 9 grew out of Johannesburg's woes but needed aliens to turn him on, Blomkamp wouldn't have explored Elysium's wealth-discrepancy angle without a sci-fi filter; he's first and foremost a visual fetishist. The idea, in fact, came to him from a National Geographic illustration of the proposed Stanford Torus space station by concept artist Syd Mead (he subsequently hired Mead to design Elysium's luxury environs). Indeed, was sold on Elysium after Blomkamp showed him his notebooks crammed with details on the film's weapons and vehicles. ""Where I'm lucky,"" Blomkamp says, ""is that the robotics and explosions and vehicles are all genuinely coming from me, and there's a large demographic of people who like that stuff."" His next film, Chappie, is a sci-fi comedy about a police robot, and will feature Ninja and Yo-Landi from , Cape Town's finest electro-rap provocateurs. Blomkamp reached out to them after seeing their debut video, and they've been itching to collaborate since (""My bodyguard help me get to the bar/ Neill Blomkamp's makin' me a movie star"", sang Yo-Landi on last year's ). ""The movie's awesome,"" raves Blomkamp of Chappie. ""Die Antwoord are playing themselves as a crime syndicate: music's not working out so they've gotten into crime in Joburg. I really love their stuff, the fusion of South African insanity that makes them cool."" Chappie will be funnier than the largely earnest Elysium, satirical rather than political, he says, and closer in tone to District 9. But either way, the edge will be there: social commentary may take a back seat to genre kicks, but it is undeniably the bedrock of Blomkamp's work. ""If you're not somewhat political or observant, I'm not sure you're an artist,"" he says. ""I'm not actually sure what you're doing."""	Film

11686	11687	Bastian Schweinsteiger confident he can cope with physicality of Premier League 	 is confident of being up to the physical demands of the Premier League, although the new United midfielder concedes he requires more time to recover at his age. Schweinsteiger turns 31 at the start of next month and has been troubled by injury in recent seasons, managing only 82 starts in the past four campaigns for Bayern Munich. Following his £ this has raised questions regarding the Germany captain’s robustness. Schweinsteiger shrugged off the comments of , the honorary Bayern president, who suggested he may not be fit enough for English football and that the MLS’s slower pace might have suited him better. He said: “I don’t know when Beckenbauer moved to America [to New York Comsos at 32]. I am 30. It is a challenge for me. I feel very good. I had last year the thing with my knee after the World Cup which was very intensive for me and I had a break at October. “But from that time on I had no injury, I was fit and felt fit at the end. Of course sometimes when you are getting older you need a little more time for recovery, maybe half a day more than 20-year-old players so that’s normal. But I think I have a lot of experience, especially of the big matches and that is an advantage always.” Beckenbauer told Passauer Neuen Presse: “I find it very brave to make a move like this at his age. People know Schweinsteiger at Bayern and know what he can do. That’s not the case in England. He will have to prove himself all over again. “Basti is 30 years old at the moment. I wish him all the best and hope he can represent German football well in England. Not a lot of players have succeeded in doing so. A move to MLS would have made more sense for me. He has to make sure he becomes fully match fit again and recharge his battery.” On being able to adjust to the Premier League, Schweinsteiger said: “I am confident. My style of play is to control a game. You have to be smart in your brain and fast. For me it is very important to control a situation in defence. You can always score goals but you have to add stability in the defence.” Paul Scholes and Roy Keane were the last United midfielders who could control the contest as Schweinsteiger hopes to. B, but the German refused to state if he could match their quality. “Not easy to say it can happen the same again,” he said. “Roy Keane and Paul Scholes were unbelievable players. You cannot compare yourself to them. It is impossible. Scholes especially, I like him a lot and I have a lot of respect for what he did for United.” Schweinsteiger is, however, confident he can help United to challenge seriously for silverware again, comparing the club’s predicament to Bayern’s when Borussia Dortmund claimed consecutive titles in 2010-11 and 2011-12. “Absolutely. That is my goal for my time here. I want to win titles and this is what is used to and I am the same. I cannot guarantee titles but I will guarantee that we will do everything to be successful in the season,” he said. “I want to make a positive impact. I think I can contribute a lot to the team. “We had two seasons when Borussia Dortmund were the champions twice in a row. I also remember the Champions League seasons before we won the treble with Jupp Heynckes [in 2012-13] – once against Inter Milan in Madrid and in Munich against Chelsea [Bayern lost in the finals]. You learn a lot from these defeats and situations. It was a progress. “It is the same at Manchester United. I know the club are looking forward to winning titles again and I am the same. They are the biggest club in the world and I am sure this team has the quality to win titles. United are more popular around the world. There is a difference and I could see that. is a big club but Manchester United is bigger. When we were in China people knew us but Bayern were not so big in America.” Schweinsteiger could make his debut in Friday’s opening tour match against Club América of Mexico in Seattle.	Football
3518	3519	Labour's manifesto: back-to-basics branding that gets straight to the point 	ou shouldn’t judge a book by its cover, mother may have said. Unless, she should have added, it is a political manifesto, whose pages of lofty promises and hollow rhetoric few voters are ever actually going to read. The cover of Labour’s manifesto, revealed in a teasing tweet by Ed Miliband on Monday morning, speaks volumes about what lies within. Rebranded as “the party of fiscal responsibility”, now comes packaged in a no-frills wrapper, exuding clarity and transparency. It is back-to-basics branding, a manual for a “better Britain” for “working people” that does exactly what it says on the tin. There’s no time for expensive agencies, either: this was all done in house. Keen to be seen as the party of responsible banking, Labour has taken lessons from First Direct’s brutally clear , spelling out its promise with stark simplicity. The message couldn’t be more direct, emblazoned in a red sans-serif typeface on a plain white background: this is a straightforward pledge from a party without the small print. With its stripped-back, text-only approach, there’s also a hint of a budget supermarket line. “It does not do what most manifestos do,” said Miliband. “It isn’t a shopping list of spending policies.” But if it was, it would be sticking exclusively to the Sainsbury’s basics range. No-nonsense nourishment for working people. More manual than manifesto, it launches straight in with: “This is a plan to reward hard work.” The word “succeed” appears twice in just 22 words, along with “working people” and “hard work”, the two sentences bookended either side by “Britain” – and underlined for good measure by “Britain can be better”. Inside, there’s no messing around with sexy graphics either. It gets straight to the point, with page one introducing the “budget responsibility lock”, like a chastity belt for the Treasury. And there’s a reason why it’s all so straight. In our new world of coalition politics the role of the manifesto has mutated. It is now less a contract with the nation than an opening bid for negotiation with the other parties. The cover doesn’t have to seduce. Labour’s online presence – a clear, issue-led site and made by , the digital agency behind Obama’s campaign – will be a more important tool for speaking to the electorate. The branding is a dramatic departure from the last election, when the cover of Labour’s 2010 manifesto presented an image drenched in nostalgia, with a family looking across rolling fields into a radiant sunburst. It combined the new dawn emblem of socialist-realist propaganda with the folksy glow of London Transport posters of the 1930s and their green and pleasant land, promising “A future fair for all”. It lost out to the Tories’ hardback blue book, with its authoritative serifed title: . This time around, Labour has no time for such pastoral pleasantries. There’s a sense of urgency in the design – indeed, there’s no time for a front cover at all. This is a government that would get straight down to business. As Miliband would put it: hell yes.

6809	6810	Co-op appoints new chief executive 	"The has ended its search for a new chief executive by appointing Richard Pennycook, who stepped in as temporary boss to steady the troubled mutual when his predecessor walked out in March. The group also announced its first-half results, which showed a return to profit after posting an annual loss of £2.5bn for 2013. In the six months to 5 July, pre-tax profit was £116m compared with a loss of £1bn in the first half of last year. But operating profit, excluding losses on discontinued operations, was down to £43m from £105m, as profits fell at its food and funeral businesses and it made losses in general insurance and legal services. Pennycook, who stepped in when the previous boss Euan Sutherland quit after details of his £6.6m pay package were leaked to the Observer, will be paid a salary of £1.3m plus bonuses. He was appointed without interviewing candidates from outside the group after the Co-op's members approved an overhaul of group governance at the weekend. The Co-op came close to collapse last year and governance reform was seen as vital to stabilise the business and allay the concerns of banks it owed £1.4bn. Ursula Lidbetter, who chairs the group, said the board could not have interviewed candidates for the job before the governance vote was passed and that it had decided to act quickly. ""It would have been very time consuming and costly to have gone out with a formal [recruitment] process. Richard has the experience and the right attributes to run a cooperative society."" Pennycook had said he was not interested in being chief executive permanently. But on Thursday he said governance reforms, including installing business people as directors to replace largely amateur Co-op members, had changed his mind. He also claimed to have been won over to the idea of co-operative values. Pennycook said: ""For me, the defining moment was the governance change at the weekend. That unlocked for me the attractive prospect of leading the organisation permanently. I had a very strong view that this is a national institution and a unique organisation which should be important in the nation. ""After many years in the plc world I was very excited by the possibility of operating in a cooperative environment where that purpose really is unique."" Lord Myners, whose report the changes were based on, told the Guardian on Sunday that the Co-op for the reforms to work effectively. Pennycook argued he and his team matched up to Myners' standards. ""If you look at the whole executive team we are strong executives largely from outside the group. In that respect, what we have on the executive team is very much what you're describing."" Pennycook joined the Co-op as chief operating officer in June 2013 from the supermarket group Morrisons where he was finance director. He was part of a new management team headed by Sutherland, a former B&Q head. Sutherland was unpopular with members who believed he wanted to turn the group, founded by the Rochdale pioneers 170 years ago and owned by its 8m customers, into a plc. When . Since taking over, Pennycook has agreed to and . On Tuesday, the group announced it was to the cash machine operator Cardtronics for up to £41.5m. Pennycook said the group would sell about 200 large food stores in the next few years and replace them with convenience stores, whose underlying sales rose by 4% in the first half. He warned that after cutting ""a number of thousands"" of jobs there would be more job reductions in store for the group's 87,000 employees but that cuts would be handled sensitively. About half the money from selling the three businesses will be used to pay off borrowing, leaving the group with about £1bn of debt, which Pennycook said was manageable. The rest will be used to revamp stores, cut prices and launch new products under the new strapline ""championing a better way of doing business for you and your communities"". The group's dividend, paid out to members according to how much they spend each year, will be put on hold."	Business
3609	3610	ITU and Google face off at Dubai conference over future of the internet 	"Two thousand delegates from 193 countries are meeting for the to negotiate a treaty on telecoms regulation that has not been updated since 1988 - before the internet was in mainstream use. Up for negotiation at WCIT are the International Telecommunications Regulations, or ITRs, which cover everything from improving internet access for the elderly and disabled, to enabling access for the 4.6bn people in the world with no access at all, improving cybersecurity and, most controversially, discussing the ""sender pays"" economic model of delivering web content. Amid all the hyperbole and acres of coverage about the future of the free internet, the treaty is the latest round of a between the internet lobby and the telecommunications companies. The west, including the corporate world and open internet advocates, claim the ""sender pays"" model would benefit larger corporations, but penalise individuals and less wealthy businesses who can't afford the bills. On the other side of the argument, mobile operators represented at WCIT by the European Telecommunications Network Operators' Association (ETNO) argue that developing countries have to establish and fund broadband networks that then enable western internet companies to reach new markets at no expense to themselves - in effect free riding on the infrastructure which costs money to install and run. Attention has swirled around political tensions that will also be played out at the WCIT, with Russia and China explicit in their desire to wrest control of the internet away from the US, and other proposals to change regulation in a way that critics say could infringe privacy and free speech. But developing countries, who have struggled to gain a voice in this debate, feel the ITU is one of very few organisations where their voices can be heard, and they too want a say in the future of the internet. Google, along with Cisco, Microsoft, Comcast and AT&T, has been part of a well-funded campaign coordinated through lawyer, former US ambassador and former US government IT policy co-ordinator David Gross. A powerful lobbying force, has played a shrewd hand, using its policy specialists and tech-celebrity executives. Vint Cerf, one of the ""fathers of the internet"" who is now ""chief internet evangelist"" at Google, has been campaigning against the ITU almost full-time for months, offering a seemingly inarguable combination of the economically and democratically essential open internet, and his winning putdowns. A lengthy comment piece in the proclaimed: ""The decisions taken in Dubai in December have the potential to put government handcuffs on the Net."" was rather less measured, quoting Cerf in a piece that began: ""If delegates have their way at next week's World Conference on International Telecommunications in Dubai, the man in charge of the Web will be a Soviet-trained apparatchik from Cold War days."" Even Cerf himself appeared to lose his composure last week when he told : ""These persistent attempts are just evidence that this breed of dinosaurs, with their pea-sized brains, hasn't figured out that they are dead yet, because the signal hasn't travelled up their long necks."" Back at the ITU, the small staff team has seemed increasingly bewildered and put on the back foot by the ferocious onslaught of press coverage against them. The ITU responded to criticism about its lack of openness by publishing WCIT material on its site, including inviting on the changes to the ITRs; only 29 were received in three months. With no small irony, ITU has even paid for Google ads next to searches for 'WCIT', hoping to redress the information balance slightly. It also claims that journalists have repeatedly published inaccurate statements about ITU without contacting it for comment, and that publications have refused to publish corrections. The ITU describes itself as an administrative body that does not make regulations, but organises negotiation of the ITRs. Individual countries are then obliged to legislate for after the process of negotiation and voting on each of the proposed changes to regulations, which number around 1,000. Speaking ahead of WCIT, ITU secretary general Dr Hamadoun Touré said: ""It is important to remember that when you talk of internet freedom, most people in the world cannot even access the internet. The internet is the rich world's privilege and ITU wants to change that. ""It is our global objective to assure that every citizen is connected no matter what their circumstance, and we need to reach a consensus no matter what the ideological view on member."" Touré also , pointing out that it is part of the ITU constitution that members should ""protect people's right to communicate and access critical communications infrastructure"". The ITU has tried to play down the apparent battle with Google, pointing out that the internet search giant is not a member of the ITU, though ETNO is. Four Google representatives, including telecom policy counsel , will attend WCIT as part of a . Cerf will not. ""We will challenge Google again to bring their points to the table,"" said Toure. ""In 1988 [the last WCIT] there was the same friction between East and West, and they managed to get over it. ""We've had 147 years of brokering agreements between member states. We have survived two world wars and 70 years of cold war, and if member states had not come together and make agreements, there would be no satellites in orbit, no spectrum allocated, no radio or television - and no internet."" ITU's secret weapon is counsellor , a former Orange and HP executive and statistician with an encyclopaedic knowledge of the telecomms industry. ""ETNO has made no bones about what it is looking for - remuneration for the additional value they believe they can provide,"" he said. ""But from friction comes light, and we believe discussion will be useful in formulating solutions that will be in the interests of all parties, and will lead to further expansion of the internet."""

At the Stadium of Light Gus Poyet did at least complete the signings of Ricardo Álvarez and Sebastián Coates on season-long loans from and Liverpool respectively. Although Álvarez has joined with a view to a £9m transfer next summer, the Argentina winger or playmaker looks something of a second-choice signing in the wake of Fabio Borini’s refusal to join Sunderland in a mooted £14m deal agreed with in July. The 26-year-old will now be expected to fill the left-sided attacking slot filled by Borini during the Italian’s loan stint at the Stadium of Light from Anfield last season. Poyet had long hoped that Borini would finally agree to sign for Sunderland but instead he stalled for weeks before heading to Queens Park Rangers at the 11th hour. Now, though, Álvarez has a chance to prove that his undeniable gifts outweigh a reputation for inconsistency acquired during his time in Serie A. Coates’ progress on Merseyside was stalled in the wake of a serious knee injury but Poyet believes the 23-year-old – who has won 15 senior caps for Uruguay – can challenge John O’Shea, Wes Brown and Santiago Vergini for a first-team place. The Sunderland manager’s faith in Coates is such that he is understood to have told his board to pursue the Uruguayan ahead of Manchester City’s Micah Richards. Valentin Roberge and Modibo Diakité are two centre-halves who made little impact after being brought in by Sunderland’s former director of football Roberto De Fanti last summer and they have departed. While Roberge returned to his native France for a season-long loan at Ligue 1 Reims, Modibo, formerly of Lazio, had his contract cancelled. He is expected to join Fiorentina. Another north-east-based defender heading to Italy was Newcastle United’s Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa. The France international, formerly with Montpellier, will spend the coming campaign at Roma and, to Alan Pardew’s dismay, will not be replaced by an incoming central defender. Pardew succeeded in his attempt to offload Hatem Ben Arfa, . Newcastle’s manager has been at loggerheads with the France creator, but getting rid of him was a high-risk strategy given he did not sign a forward. Ben Arfa, exiled from Newcastle’s first team, turned down a transfer to Turkey’s Besiktas at the weekend and then a loan to the Championship club Birmingham on Monday. Undeterred, Pardew instructed his board to “do whatever it takes” to shift a player who remains extremely popular with Newcastle fans and, despite Ben Arfa reiterating his long-standing determination to stay at St James’ Park, agreed a move to Hull. Pardew had hoped to greet a new striker but the chances of one arriving looked to be receding as the hours passed. Earlier the club had withdrawn from tentative discussions about borrowing Danny Welbeck from Manchester United when the size of the loan fee became apparent and are believed to have had little interestein transplanting Jermain Defoe from Toronto to Tyneside.

Rooney is at the centre of a row between Chelsea and United over a by the Premier League champions. Mourinho was low key when commenting on the offer in Bangkok, despite United provoking the Blues' ire. confirmed they want to buy Rooney, who is in dispute with United over comments made by the manager David Moyes when he spoke to journalists in Bangkok last week. However, they are furious at suggestions that David Luiz or Juan Mata had been offered as makeweights in the deal. Speaking in Bangkok following the first match of his second spell in charge – a 1-0 win over Singha All-Stars – Mourinho declined the opportunity to fuel the argument. ""I think that this situation is clear – nothing is a secret anymore,"" he said. ""The official bid is just about a certain amount of money and doesn't involve players. ""We want the player. We made the bid and now we have nothing more to say. Now it's up to Manchester United."" Asked if Chelsea had made any other bids, Mourinho said: ""No, and we won't.""

6852	6853	Is Angry Birds Stella sexist? 'We want to challenge stereotypes,' says Rovio 	 is the latest game in Finnish firm Rovio’s flappy franchise. Its pink heroine is joined by three female friends and a female arch-enemy; the game’s slogan is “best friends forever – most of the time”; and its aims include celebrating “female heroism”. Angry Birds For Girls, then? Which is a controversial thought, given that has always appealed to both sexes, particularly among the children who are its most fervent fans. Angry Birds Stella risks looking like an attempt to ghettoise female fans: Star Wars, Transformers, karting and RPGs over here for the boys, and something pinker and simpler for the girls over there. Blanca Juti, Rovio’s chief marketing officer, makes the company’s case against this interpretation. “Just as I hope people don’t think Star Wars is for boys, I hope they don’t say this is just for girls,” she says. “We want to challenge stereotypes, both on girls – that they only play easy games – and on boys, that they don’t like anything pink. We really want to challenge this, and there is already a bit of a movement around it.” Juti says that when Rovio had a playable version of Angry Birds Stella on its stand at the recent Comic-Con convention “a lot of guys came to play”, and more convincingly, that just over 50% of people watching the game’s trailer on Facebook have been men. “It does celebrate women: we have five female heroes and one male, and all the pigs... well, we don’t know what they are. But most importantly, we wanted to make a kick-ass game. I do think it will attract females as well. I hope it does. But it is not just for girls.” You can look at Angry Birds Stella in two ways. A pinkified gaming-ghetto for girls sounds bad. A game with strong female heroes that’s played by lots of boys as well as girls sounds pretty progressive, though. Having played it, I can testify that it’s not easier than previous Angry Birds games too. It will be interesting to see how reactions play out once the game is available, with cartoons, toys, merchandise and books to follow later in the year. Boys and girls? There’s another sensitive topic when it comes to Angry Birds, which is how Rovio balances its appeal to children with the company’s desire to adopt the “free-to-play” business model that’s become so dominant in the mobile games world: giving the games away for free, then selling in-app purchases. Angry Birds Stella has in-app purchases going up to £37.99 for a chest of 7,500 virtual coins. Par for the course in free-to-play games, but a potential eyebrow-raiser for parents whose children are playing – if not quite as big as the sight of last year. “You can totally play the game without having to purchase stuff, but then on the other hand, if you want to purchase stuff, you can,” says Juti. “That’s where the industry is going: people want to get the game for free, but somehow you need to be able to build the game. It’s an industry standard now. For us, free-to-play is a positive thing: it makes it extremely accessible to people around the world.” The other big challenge for Rovio and Angry Birds in 2014 is staying relevant. Juti talks enthusiastically about its mainstream reach – “three to 103 year-olds: very few things in life, probably chocolate and Angry Birds, that have such wide appeal” – but there have been signs that its growth has stalled. to €156m (£128.4m), while stripping out its consumer products income revealed that the income from the Angry Birds games actually fell slightly year-on-year. In its results for 2012, Rovio said it ended the year with 263m monthly active players, but the lack of a comparable figure in its 2013 results hinted that the number may have fallen. Meanwhile, the company’s income pales next to that of rivals like Clash of Clans maker and Candy Crush Saga publisher King (£1.1bn). Is Angry Birds falling back to earth? Unsurprisingly, Juti disagrees. She cites a survey recently commissioned by Rovio in the US, Brazil, Korea and Finland that found an average “aided brand awareness” of 91%, rivalling well established brands like Disney and Lego. That shows that people recognise Angry Birds, but it doesn’t necessarily prove that they love it and are still willing to spend money on it. That said, some of the other companies that Rovio has been compared to are encountering their own difficulties: witness evidence that . “From the beginning, our aim has been to build a brand for 100 years, not 100 days. We have Stella coming in, Angry Birds Transformers coming out next month, another game soft-launched in Finland that’s coming soon too. So quite a lot of stuff coming this fall,” says Juti. “And we have a movie in the making too.” The mystery soft-launched game may be , a Flappy Bird-esque action game that has been tested in Rovio’s home country since May, although it’s not an Angry Birds game. Having dug around Apple’s App Store in Finland, there’s also a non-game app, , which soft-launched there earlier this year but has yet to be released in the web. And ToonsTV might actually be Rovio’s best defence against claims of the company’s imminent decline. Already available within other Angry Birds apps and on the web, ToonsTV has quietly become a Netflix-style TV network for kids, populated by Rovio’s own cartoons, but also shows from partners including Transformers and Fraggle Rock. 3bn video views since March 2013, and growing advertising from big brands, suggests ToonsTV is becoming an important second string for Rovio’s bow. “I would say to the sceptics, maybe hold on a little bit and play a few games,” says Juti. “We have built this brand on many levels, through the games, toons, parks, products, and in different countries you can see that one or other is consumed more. Well, that’s fine.”	Technology
12230	12231	Anthony Hopkins to give us a Lear 	"The Oscar-winning actor is to play King Lear in a new film version of the Shakespeare tragedy, it was confirmed today. The film will feature Gwyneth Paltrow, Naomi Watts and Keira Knightley as Lear's three daughters, with more big names to be revealed soon, according to the director, Joshua Michael Stern. ""The one thing that I'm staying away from is stunt casting,"" said Stern, ""so there won't be the American comedian, but there will be some really great actors playing smaller roles that will make a lot of sense."" Despite Stern's background - he's scripted episodes of Law & Order and Chicago Hope - he insists he won't be meddling with the original text. ""I'm not very fond of the modern adaptations,"" he said. ""It's pre-Roman, Celtic, very raw. It's a period in British history, from which Tolkien took a lot of his inspiration, where there were thatched-roof roundhouses and fortresses."" Stern's previous directorial efforts have been limited to a couple of comedy shorts: Queer Eye for the Homeless Guy and Jewz N The Hood, both shot in 2005. Hopkins is said to be ""thrilled"" at the chance to reprise the role he played in David Hare's production of the play at the National 21 years ago in 1987. Shooting is scheduled to begin in Britain or Ireland early next year."	Film
8054	8055	Eurozone chiefs strike deal to extend Greek bailout for four months 	 has stepped back from the prospect of a disorderly eurozone exit after reaching a last-ditch deal to resolve the impasse over its €240bn (£177bn) bailout. The outline agreement between Athens and its creditors in the single currency bloc to extend Greece’s rescue loans should help ease concerns that it was heading for the exit door from the euro. In return, the country’s leftwing government has pledged not to roll back austerity measures attached to the rescue, and must submit, before the end of Monday, a list of reforms that it plans to make. The chairman of the eurozone finance chiefs’ group, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, said Athens had given its “unequivocal commitment to honour their financial obligations” to creditors. He said that the agreement was a “first step in this process of rebuilding trust” between Greece and its eurozone partners which would provide a strategy to get the country back on track. A senior Greek government official welcomed the agreement, saying it gave Athens time to negotiate a new deal. “Greece has turned a page,” the official added. Greece’s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, claimed victory, insisting there was “no substantive difference” between the deal and a Greek compromise text that had been dismissed by Germany’s finance ministry as a Trojan horse for Athens to throw off austerity. “We are going to write our own script on the reforms that need to be enacted,” he said But the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, will almost certainly face fierce reaction over the deal, both from hardliners in his radical left Syriza party and from the populist rightwing Anel – his junior partner in the governing coalition – for agreeing to continue with austerity measures as part of the deal, given that he was elected on an . “Very heavy concessions have been made, politically poisonous concessions for the government,” Pavlos Tzimas, the veteran political commentator, told SKAI news. The make-or-break talks began more than three hours late, delayed because of last-ditch preparatory talks involving the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, and his Greek counterpart, Varoufakis. This discussion yielded a fresh compromise to extend Greece’s loan agreement for four months, buying time for further negotiations on Greece’s vast debts, which stand at 175% of its economic output. The agreement to stave off an imminent cash crunch in Greece was achieved despite a backdrop of fractious public exchanges between European politicians and the newly elected Syriza government in Athens. The accord sets Greece a deadline of Monday to send a letter to the 19-nation group listing all the policy measures it plans to take during the remainder of the bailout period, to ensure they comply with the conditions and receive vital funds. But if ministers reject the next round of reforms, which have to be agreed by the end of April, “we are in trouble” said Varoufakis. If the three institutions overseeing the bailout – the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund – are satisfied after an initial view, eurozone member states will ratify the extension. The ongoing role of the troika – now renamed the institutions – represents a climbdown for Tsipras and Varoufakis, who had pledged to cease dealing with troika inspectors. Another concession is that Greece will remain constrained by the budget targets agreed with its eurozone partners. Although it can ease austerity, it will have to find another way of arriving at the same budget target. “The only commitment that we took today is that whatever measure we take will not affect fiscal stability,” Varoufakis said. Despite the restrictions, Varoufakis promised Syriza would not go ahead with pension cuts and VAT hikes that the previous Conservative government had planned. Instead of these austerity measures, Syriza plans to meet its budget targets with a crackdown on tax evasion – although Varoufakis admitted he had “no idea” how much this would add to government coffers: “If I gave you a number I would be lying.” However, Schäuble, one of the toughest critics of the Greek government’s negotiating stance, indicated that Syriza will have to back austerity measures that it had vowed to repeal. “The Greeks certainly will have a difficult time explaining the deal to their voters,” he said. The Irish finance minister, Michael Noonan, also voiced caution about the prospects of success, telling reporters: “It’s an important first step that we hope will lead to a successful second step on Monday night or Tuesday morning, but then of course there’s a third step with ratifications in parliament.” Without a deal, Greece faced the prospect of quickly running out of cash because it is effectively locked out of the international lending markets. Its banking system, on life support from the ECB, is losing deposits at a rate of about €2bn a week. A €1bn shortfall in revenues for January – caused by some Greeks delaying tax payments in the runup to the election – has added to the strain on government finances. The Syriza party, which swept to power in January with a promise to end Greece’s humanitarian crisis, is pressing to lift the austerity measures imposed by eurozone creditors in exchange for the bailout. Syriza had been campaigning for a bridging loan to ride out immediate funding concerns, while it renegotiates the bailout terms. But the rest of the eurozone was opposed to a new loan deal unless Greece pledges to continue the austerity programme – which has included privatisations and public sector job cuts. Last night’s deal indicated that tough limits on public spending will have to remain. “Greece has folded this hand, but the game of poker continues,” Raoul Ruparel of Open said. US stocks closed at record highs last night after the deal between Greece and its creditors in the eurozone. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up more than 150 points, its first record close for 2015. The S&P 500 ended the week at its third record close for the year. 	Business
6062	6063	Sunderland 2-1 Southampton 	"Forget the prospect of a League Cup quarter-final here against Gus Poyet's one-time employers, Chelsea, next month, the really good news for Sunderland's manager is that Wes Brown played a full 90 minutes. Even better, the former England defender looked almost as good as new, as paid the price for not taking a chance of silverware sufficiently seriously, surrendering tamely to goals from Phil Bardsley and Sebastian Larsson. ""Wes Brown's class, he knows how to play the game,"" said Poyet, who was delighted with some much-improved passing from his team. ""To have Chelsea here in the next round is going to be very special for me."" Mauricio Pochettino made 10 changes, fielding a very much second-string Southampton side but Poyet proved somewhat more circumspect in his rotation. While Brown – finally fit again after appalling knee trouble that very nearly ended his career –began a home game for the first time since January 2012, Poyet only found room in Sunderland's starting XI for five of the 14 summer signings secured by Roberto De Fanti, the club's director of football. Few on view set the place alight at first. The slowest of low tempo first halves may have presented an encouragingly assured looking Brown with the ideal re-introduction to first-team life but concluded with neither goalkeeper having made a save. Poyet experimented with a 4-1-4-1 formation featuring Jozy Altidore as the lone striker and Ki Sung-yueng screening midfield. The idea was to help Sunderland's players ""take much better care of the ball"" and, ultimately, it worked. Initially, though, Southampton were not stretched. At least the 47th minute featured a save, Kelvin Davis repelling Craig Gardner's shot with his legs after Altidore's adroit flick on. Under 16,000 were there to see it. That is an awfully low crowd at this 49,000-capacity arena but, following one Premier League win all season, supporters' overriding priority is relegation avoidance. Those present would have been heartened by Brown's smooth passing out of defence along with some promising central midfield cameos from the ever-dependable Jack Colback. Appropriately both were involved in the preamble to Bardsley's goal. Bardsley has hardly been a model professional in recent months but Paolo Di Canio's former bete noire broke the impasse. The full-back extended his right boot and bundled the loose ball over the line when Davis could not quite hold Altidore's powerful header after Brown flicked on an Adam Johnson free-kick, awarded for Jack Cork's foul on Colback. Although Larsson subsequently connected with Altidore's unselfish pass and swept a shot past Davis, right footed it was not quite a perfect night for Poyet. His defence fell apart at a set piece, conceding a late goal when, courtesy of Jos Hooiveld's flick, Maya Yoshida headed James Ward-Prowse's free-kick beyond the impressive Vito Mannone. Clearly underwhelmed, Pochettino's haste to board Southampton's flight south was such that he swerved post-match media duties."	Football
10675	10676	Greek PM seeks bailout ratification as doubts remain over German support 	Greece’s parliament will convene for an emergency session to ratify the text of a new multibillion-euro bailout, according to the parliament website, but the timing of the crucial vote remained uncertain and doubts persisted about whether the deal enjoyed the full support of all EU capitals. It was not clear when MPs, recalled from their summer recess on Tuesday by prime minister Alexis Tsipras, would begin discussing the 400-page bill at committee level, with that parliamentary committees would probably not meet until Thursday morning, hours before the plenary debate and a vote now likely to take place in the early hours of Friday. Tsipras called for parliament to reconvene on an €85bn (£61bn) package aimed at saving the debt-stricken country from bankruptcy and securing its future in the euro. The government wants parliament to ratify the bailout, Greece’s third in five years, so it can be approved by eurozone finance ministers at a meeting planned for Friday – allowing a vital first tranche to be disbursed in time for a major €3.4bn debt payment Athens is due to make to the on 20 August. But while initial reaction to the agreement was positive in Brussels and many EU capitals, there were concerns the deal may come unstuck, with the that the deal could run into opposition, particularly in Germany. “The Greek government’s greatest concern is that German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, will reiterate his opposition to a deal and insist should instead be granted a bridging loan” to allow it to meet its €3.2bn debt payment to the ECB on 20 August, the newspaper said. Citing government sources, it added that the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, worried about the domestic political fallout, had made similar noises on Tuesday in a conversation with Tsipras, saying Germany was “sceptical” about the agreement and wanted a bridge loan instead of a full agreement, which she suggested required more detailed discussion. The AFP news agency also quoted EU sources as saying that while a technical agreement had been reached, political agreement was not yet certain and it was far from sure the deal would be finalised by 20 August, meaning Athens might need emergency funding to pay its ECB debt. “We might need a few days’ bridging funding,” one EU source told AFP. “In that case, we need all the member states” to approve the loan. The outline deal requires Greece to impose a raft of 35 fiscal and other market reform measures, from overhauling the gas market through liberalising pharmacies to selling off state property, revamping the welfare system, opening up closed professions, scrapping most early retirement schemes, cutting fuel price benefits for farmers and raising taxes. If it is approved, the draft agreement would bring to a close a bruising chapter of negotiations between Greece and its creditors: the ECB, International Monetary Fund, European commission and European Stability Mechanism. Tsipras’s leftist Syriza party, which swept to power in January elections promising to end the austerity programmes that have plunged Greece into deep recession and pushed unemployment to a record 25%, has had to make a painful policy U-turn. A sizeable bloc of dissident Syriza MPs is likely to oppose the package in Thursday’s vote, which all deputies are required to attend. The rebels argue that the agreement is “a noose around the neck” of the Greek people and the country’s economy as well as a betrayal of Syriza’s campaign pledges. But support from Syriza’s coalition partners and the main opposition parties will almost certainly ensure Athens ratifies the deal, which among other measures provides for an immediate €10bn cash injection for the country’s struggling banks.

2462	2463	Ukip's Godfrey Bloom: 'I just can't resist a punch-up' 	"odfrey Bloom's study in his Yorkshire home looks so exactly as one would expect that it could almost be a stage set. The walls are lined with military figurines, sporting trophies, photos of rugby teams and a ceremonial cricket bat, and the occupant plays the part of a blimpish ex-army caricature with terrific brio. He barks, ""Bloom here. Hello my dear boy!"" down the phone, refers to his wife as ""Mrs Bloom"", wears a tweed cap, drives an MG, and loves to get roaring drunk. He'd enjoyed a particularly satisfactory seven-hour drinking session in Brussels only two days earlier. ""Hit it hard. And the beer there is all five on the Richter scale. At the rugby club it's 3.5. I can drink 3.5 all day."" is a lament for the 50s and the golden era of empire, the vernacular of ""iffy"" and ""whizzo"" and a cavalier approach to punctuation evidently all his own work, unless PG Wodehouse has taken up ghostwriting. Incorrigibly unbiddable and surprisingly camp, he reminds me of . Unlike most politicians, Bloom loves to be interviewed, because ""I never have to worry about what I said last time, because I've never changed my views."" About anything? ""No. Never."" His brain, he boasts, tapping a temple, is ""hermetically sealed."" But beneath all the sergeant's mess cliches there seems to be a surprisingly thoughtful person. A former financial analyst, he likes to digress into little lessons on economic history, and obviously wishes people would see what an erudite intellectual he is. ""Most people don't know how the government fiddles the numbers. I do."" He's a dreadful show off, so there are constant references to political theorists, but he is genuinely interested in ideas, and certainly cleverer than most people probably imagine. Whether anyone could ever be as clever as he likes to see himself, I am not sure. When I ask who the brain of Ukip is today he hoots, ""There are no brains of the party."" It used to be him? ""Well, certainly one of the leading brains, yes."" What about – what's he like when it comes to policy? Bloom lets out a great snort. ""He's not interested. He's not interested in the running of the party, or in making policy. He's Ukip's chief salesman, that's what Nigel is."" Bloom and Farage have been great friends ever since the early days of Ukip. They share a flat in Brussels, a near-identical sense of humour and a manner so alike that if I close my eyes it could be Farage in the room. But at Ukip's conference in September , after Bloom risked an ill-advised joke about women being ""sluts"", and whacked the Channel 4 news reporter Michael Crick over the head with a rolled-up conference programme. Bloom refers to the ding-dong as ""Crickgate"", and is not unaware of its comic dimension. I'm sure Bloom had resolved not to say anything unkind about Farage today – and on a personal level he mostly manages to be generous and warm. When it comes to politics, however, he cannot help himself. Farage, he despairs, can't take criticism, goes to pieces in a crisis, is really a conservative, and doesn't even want to lead the party. ""He's not a team player, you see. He didn't play rugger. Plays golf!"" Bloom accuses Ukip's leader of pursuing an ""Ein Führer"" leadership policy and a ""No-policy"" policy agenda, and claims Farage has already struck a secret election deal with the Tories in return for a seat in the Lords. Relations had been breaking down since the spring, when Farage appeared to change his mind about flat tax in the middle of . Bloom asked what was going on, and ""I got a quite hysterical text back: 'Your job is to get out there delivering leaflets instead of asking me about policy!' I thought, I'm your economics spokesman. You want me to deliver ? Hysterical!"" Things got worse in July after . Unnerved by the media uproar, Farage told him to apologise. ""I said, 'I don't do apologies. If you keep a cool head, you will find it swings my way.'"" I don't know anyone who changed their mind and decided ""Bongo bongo land"" wasn't highly offensive after all – but Bloom insists: ""We got more than 15,000 emails, only 47 against. I think we can deduce from that that I had massive public support."" But that was when the real trouble set in. Farage complained to him: ""Whenever I'm interviewed now, people want to talk about you."" Bloom thinks his friend became threatened by his media profile and public popularity, and that Crickgate had a lot to do with jealousy. ""I'd taken the spotlight off his speech, that's what it was all about! It was toys out of the pram. Let's be brutally honest. He panicked."" Farage should have simply said the matter was being investigated, the media were ""trying to crack us, but we're going to stick together"", and moved on. ""And the whole audience would have cheered."" He parodies the speech Farage did actually make, putting on a petulant, high-pitched wail and flapping his arms over his shoulders. ""That's it! Conference is ruined! Oh the conference is ruined!' You know what one elderly Ukip lady said to me afterwards?"" he can't resist adding, ""'He gives girls a bad name'."" When Farage phoned him up, ""He'd lost it badly. Oh, he was really in pieces. It was: 'Conference is over! No one's going to look at my speech now!'"" But later that day the party secretary told Bloom not to worry, assuring him, ""We'll smooth it all over. We can't afford to lose you, you're too popular."" Bloom woke up the next day, ""and there was Nigel Farage on the television, sacking me. I turn on and I'm being sacked on the telly! It was like seeing your father disinherit you on TV because you broke a casserole dish."" Bloom didn't think Crickgate had been that big a deal – ""Nothing more than if I'd whacked a wasp in a pub garden"". He doesn't see how his dismissal could have had anything to do with the sluts joke or the Crick wallop, because his name was removed from the party's MEP list less than 90 minutes later, before any investigation could have taken place. And he claims Ukip's success in the north is almost entirely down to him, adding: ""I've put more money into this party than has up here. £150 grand. Yeah. From my private savings. ""So why,"" he asks, ""would they get rid of a huge electoral asset?"" He feigns bafflement, before practically shouting: ""Because I am diametrically opposed to any deal with the Conservative party! I would never have agreed to it, on a matter of a principle – so I had to go."" According to Bloom, Ukip is in the grip of an internal battle for its future. At HQ ""they are all stabbing each other in the back"", and the grassroots are being deliberately squeezed out. ""They have been purged. This is 1933 Germany, night of the long knives. I'm waiting to be dragged out of the pub and butchered. This is New Ukip now. And they are looking for a deal with the Tories."" Officially, Ukip's politics are libertarian. But Bloom says Farage has always really been a Conservative, is ""desperate to be a Conservative again"", and would pack it all in if we would just get out of and crack down on immigration. ""But we're winning those arguments. We've broken through. Now we're in phase two. We've said what we don't want, and now we have to say what we do want."" Farage, apparently, disagrees. The party's radical libertarian ideas frighten him. More importantly, they would make an electoral pact with the Tories in 2015 much trickier. And so, says Bloom, he has been marginalising grassroots members, sacking troublesome rivals, and turning himself into ""a professional politician, with a professional party, so he can be within some alliance with the Conservative party"". Bloom had to be elbowed out before a pact could be agreed. ""And,"" he says with confidence, ""the deal has already now been done."" He's unclear on its precise details, but certain that Farage's reward for standing down Ukip candidates in key seats is a title and a seat in the House of Lords. Would he want that? Bloom chuckles knowingly – ""Not for him, of course!"" – and adopts a weaselly, ever-so-'umble voice. ""'But should one be forced upon me, then for the good of the party, and if people felt I could better serve there, well then … ' Of course he would!"" Remarkably, Bloom and Farage are still friends. They met a few weeks after conference – in a pub, of course – and decided the disagreement was ""strictly professional"". But Bloom isn't going quietly. He says the whole business has been a blessing – his media profile has doubled, and he's showered in good will wherever he goes. ""Now I don't have Ukip antichrist on my forehead, everybody's much friendlier! Really, it's a weight off my shoulders. Because now I'm not hamstrung by the no-policy policy, I can start to talk about policy."" Bloom would do away with the welfare state in its entirety, and ""get back to the self-help we had in the 19th century. I'm a big believer in Friendly Societies."" Income tax would be flat, all drug use would be decriminalised, and drivers could drink as much as they liked, as long as they could prove they were still fit to drive. (""I could drive perfectly well after four pints."") The NHS would no longer be free, and in fact it would be a crime to call any public provision ""free"". He's deviating a little here from libertarian principle, he admits. ""But it's not free! We all have to pay for it."" We disagree about literally everything. But though I think his politics are wrong in every way, they aren't irrational, nor a ragbag of random prejudice. Every now and then he'll lapse into rugby club after-dinner speaker mode, which is hectoring and boring. But most of the time he is really thinking, and doesn't get defensive about flaws in his logic, but positively lights up. He says he wants strict, Canadian-style immigration controls, but surely, I suggest, once he's got rid of the welfare state he should open our borders to the world. The population would self-regulate by everyone competing on a level playing field, and indigenous Britons who didn't like it could move elsewhere. He looks faintly startled, but quickly thinks it through. ""If we could get rid of the welfare state that would work, ye-es. There would be no need for controls. Subject to criminal and health checks, of course."" Followed through to its logical conclusion, Bloom's libertarianism leads him to problematic places. When he fails to justify opposing gay marriage on libertarian grounds, he admits, ""Well, I do want to conserve some things."" He wants to protect people like the Christian B&B owners who turned away a gay couple, arguing ""they should be allowed to say exactly who comes in and out of their property"". Presumably pub landlords then should be allowed to put signs in their window saying ""No blacks""? ""Oh. Never really thought about it, actually."" He swears he has never understood racism, doesn't even notice skin colour, and can't imagine why any publican would turn away customers. But after careful consideration he says, ""Well, I do believe a publican should be allowed to say who he has in his establishment. So yes, his gaff, his rules."" Given the hot water this should land him in, I find the loyalty to his own libertarian logic oddly touching. I sincerely hope he's wrong in thinking most voters share his views. He has decided not to stand as an independent MEP next year – ""I wouldn't have any trouble winning. But do I want to? Nah. Ten years of this game's enough."" But he might run for Westminster in 2015. ""I just can't resist a punch-up, that's the trouble really. I just think it would be a bit of a lark, wouldn't it?"""	Politics
916	917	Big six energy firms to be targeted by fuel poverty protesters 	"Direct action groups including UK Uncut are planning a series of protests at the headquarters of , British Gas and other large energy companies. More than a thousand people are expected to demonstrate against the big six next Tuesday – the day that the latest winter mortality figures are published by the Office for National Statistics. Protesters will meet under the banner ""Bring down the big six – fuel poverty kills"" at Exchange Square in the centre of the City of London before marching with coffins filled with energy bills to npower's supply and trading offices at Threadneedle Street. Oxford-based campaigners will demonstrate outside the new headquarters of British Gas there, with further protests planned for Bristol and Lewes in Sussex. ""People must be put before profit, and with creative direct action, we will stand with the elderly, the poor and vulnerable to fight for our power. Fuel must end,"" said Sarah Price of UK Uncut. ""The big six are an example of incredible corporate greed. Huge profits are extracted from the public whilst they suffer at the hands of austerity. David Cameron and his cabinet of millionaires are only too happy to stuff the pockets of big business while ordinary people are left out in the cold."" James Grainger of Fuel Poverty Action, also involved in the protests, said people were angry that the big six had tried to blame green taxes for putting up bills. ""The real problems are the big six's profiteering and the rising cost of polluting energy like oil and gas. is a basic need, too important to be left in the hands of profit-hungry private companies. ""A combination of publicly owned and community controlled renewable energy – alongside mass insulation – is the way to bring bills down and stop people dying from cold."" The energy debate has become ever more heated since firms raised their fuel bills earlier this month. Next week's annual statistics on ""excess winter mortality"" will not break down how many of these extra deaths were caused by cold homes, but the World Health Authority estimated that 7,200 of the 24,000 extra British mortalities last winter were due to houses without proper heating. Betty Cottingham of the Greater London Pensioners Association, which is also supporting the protests, said her members had limited time to wait or change. ""We want an immediate response to the dire circumstances that pensioners live in. Jumpers are not a solution. The solution is to take back the fuel industries into public ownership, and to see them as a public service and not something for someone to make a fortune out of."" Npower has become a particular target for critics because the company has been at the centre of rows over tax, overcharging and most recently coming top of the customer complaints league."	Business
11551	11552	Louis van Gaal: David de Gea does not want to play for Manchester United 	David de Gea’s increasingly fragile position at has been further destabilised after Louis van Gaal took the unexpected decision to go public with new details about the current standoff behind the scenes at Old Trafford, including the damaging revelation that the goalkeeper expressly told the club he did not want to be part of the team. Van Gaal, who confirmed his interest in the Barcelona attacker Pedro, said on Friday because he does not think the Spaniard can be relied upon when he has been pinning his hopes all summer on a move to Real Madrid. However, Van Gaal also said the origins of that decision came from a meeting eight days ago when, according to the United manager, De Gea was asked outright if he wanted to play and told the club’s coaching staff he did not want to be involved because he was too distracted. That, in turn, prompted Van Gaal to hold a separate meeting with his assistants, when they decided they should remove De Gea from their plans and bring the Argentina international Sergio Romero into the team, since Víctor Valdés had already burnt his bridges at Old Trafford. “We talked with him [De Gea] and he fully agreed with our decision,” Van Gaal said. “I have one assistant coach and another assistant coach so we speak about that kind of thing together. We have a goalkeeping coach, Frans Hoek, and I’m not doing everything alone. “Frans Hoek … he has a meeting with David de Gea and he asked him: ‘Do you want to play?’” Asked what the response was, Van Gaal said: “‘No.’ Then I have to take the decision. It is a process. We had been observing him in preparation, he was not so good, he was not the same David de Gea as before. He was my best player last season. According to the fans, he was the best of the last two years.” Van Gaal’s revelations came after a press conference when he had been asked about De Gea’s position and made it clear there was no change – “he remains out of the squad” – before saying it would be better to discuss it in a “more intimate setting later”. At the end of his conference, he took a seat beside the journalist who had asked him whether De Gea actually wanted to play and, clarifying that he was still talking on-the-record, proceeded to say it was the goalkeeper’s wish to be left out of the squad. His comments were unusual, not just in the way they were delivered but because they also go against the club’s usual policy of trying to keep private conversations in-house. De Gea’s camp have been saying that he would have been happy to play and that it was wrong of Van Gaal to say he was not fully focused. Van Gaal’s version of events sheds an entirely new light on the affair, with little over two weeks to determine whether De Gea will get the move he craves or be left contemplating a difficult season running down the final year of his contract at a club he plainly wants to leave. Van Gaal was asked whether De Gea could win his place back if he was still in Manchester after the transfer window closes. “That depends on Romero and his form,” he said. United did, however, later stipulate they had no issues with De Gea’s professionalism. While Madrid have been eyeing up De Gea without coming up with a suitable fee, and are waiting for the Barcelona player to let them know if he is willing to leave the Champions League and La Liga winners. “You have to ask Pedro, not me,” Van Gaal said. “My answer is that it’s a process between a club and a player, and we are there also. I don’t mention anything before he has signed. When he has signed I will come to you and say: ‘Hey, Pedro is here.’ That is not the case and we shall wait to see.” Van Gaal was reminded he had spoken previously about bringing in more fast, penetrative players now Ángel Di María had left for Paris Saint-Germain. “I hear, and Pedro is a player like that,” he said. “So write it.” As it is, Van Gaal’s lack of attacking options led to him saying he wanted to keep Javier Hernández, albeit only as Wayne Rooney’s understudy, when United were previously keen to sell him. He also stated Adnan Januzaj was “still not for sale” but Sunderland have approached United about a loan arrangement for a player who did not even get on the bench against Spurs last weekend. The likelihood is that a deal will be finalised if Pedro joins but there is also a chance PSG will move for him as well.	Football
12898	12899	J Edgar is a woefully boring movie 	"he one noteworthy thing about is that it's a sympathetic, entirely non-homophobic gay love story directed by . It might even have extra resonance if you recollect that gay kid in the park in Dirty Harry, fluttering his eyelashes at a clearly repulsed Detective Callahan and piping, ""My name is Alice, and I've been known to take a dare!"" This one pleasing development aside, J Edgar marks another point on the downward trajectory of Eastwood's recent directorial career: The Changeling, Invictus, Hereafter – it's all painful, rickety stuff. This murky and uninvolving biopic half hero-worships and half hates the late FBI Director (systematised fingerprinting – yay! ""There is no organised crime in the USA"" – boo!), seeing him as a deeply closeted, mother-fixated control freak. Hoover's deepening, marriage-like relationship with his hand-reared assistant director Clyde Tolson is intercut with glimpses of canned history – the Palmer raids, the slandering of Dr King, the compromising private files … But no Joe McCarthy nor his ruthless chief counsel Roy Cohn, not enough Nixon and no substantial mention of Cointelpro, the pharaonic, black-propaganda campaign against 1960s civil rights workers and the student left. acquits himself well enough from beneath a thick icing of facial prosthetics. As the declamatory, public-face Hoover, he gets the voice just right; as the private Hoover, however, lost in the film's monotonously sepia-toned murkiness, he's defeated by the script and the makeup department. Larry Cohen's boldface-tabloidish – made in 1977, only five years after Hoover's death – was criticised on release as an overwrought slur on Hoover. But much of its content has been confirmed elsewhere since, and we have become accustomed to the notion of a gay, perhaps even cross-dressing Hoover. J Edgar, by contrast, often wimps out. During his long sojourn at the pinnacle of power, Hoover had the studios at his beck and call. He cannily associated the Bureau with Warner Bros' 1935 Jimmy Cagney vehicle, , which helped seal the steely public image of the FBI. Hoover appeared in 1959's alongside Jimmy Stewart, and was a paid consultant on its long-running spin-off TV show, . Since Hoover's death, though, there's been a compensatory flood of hostile portrayals: Vincent Gardenia in the mini series Kennedy, Ernest Borgnine in 1983's Blood Feud, , and many others. The Eastwood-DiCaprio version is a landmark portrait trapped inside a woefully boring movie. Better to wait for Harry Shearer's comic stage musical J Edgar!, and to hope for its original cast intact: Kelsey Grammer as Hoover, John Goodman as Tolson. I'll take that dare, Alice."	Film
9328	9329	'Here's Johnny!': The Shining scene is scariest in movie history, claims study 	"The ""Here's Johnny"" scene from Stanley Kubrick's is officially the scariest movie moment of all time, according to a new study. Website Play.com polled 10,000 users to find the 10 films that most frightened customers, then used heart rate monitors to find out which scenes delivered the greatest chills. scored the scariest scene, with scenes from Wes Craven's original 1984 and in second and third place respectively. The most frightening scenes were calculated by identifying the percentage increases in film-goers' heart rates from spikes occurring at the same moments. The ""Here's Johnny"" scene, in which 's deranged writer peers through a hole in a door he has just created with an axe, made pulses jump by 28.2%. A Nightmare on Elm Street's most frightening moment, in which Nancy Thompson brings killer Freddy Krueger from her dream into the real world, caused a 26.7% increase in the average heart rate. The Exorcist's scariest bit, when Christine MacNeil investigates a strange noise in her attic, raised pulses by 24.8%. The three movies changed positions, however, when viewer reaction to the films in their entirety was taken into account. The Exorcist came top over the long haul, sending pulses racing by an average of 25.9%. was second with 25.9%, with The Shining bringing up the rear on 23.3%. When these figures were combined with the scariest moment scores, however, The Shining reclaimed first place, with second and A Nightmare on Elm Street third. ""It's interesting to see just how close the top three films' scare ratings were,"" said Shingo Murakami, managing director of Play.com's Japanese owner, Rakuten. ""It seems The Shining's extended periods of tension and soundtrack kept viewers' hearts racing throughout, but simply couldn't match the massive terror induced by Freddy Krueger's multiple gruesome murders or The Exorcist's explicit exorcism."" The study also found that watching the three scariest films affected viewers' heart rates in a similar manner to light exercise.

8877	8878	OKCupid experiments are standard 'scientific methods', says founder 	OKCupid’s co-founder has attacked the concept of ethical oversight during experiments on internet users, following his defence of the practice in a blogpost titled “ ”. Christian Rudder accepted blame for stoking the fires around the topic, admitting that his initial blogpost was “sensationally written”, but stood by the argument that experimenting on users was “just part of the scientific method”. , Rudder said that there was no consideration given to letting users opt-in to experimentation, because “once people know that they’re being studied along a particular axis, inevitably they’re gonna act differently. “I was in some psych experiments when I was in college, just because they give you 20 bucks to go to the department and you, y’know, you sign a form. But that is informed consent – which users can’t see, but I’m putting in quotes.” Asked by the host, Alex Goldman, if OKCupid had ever considered bringing in an ethicist to vet the experiments, Rudder said: “To wring his hands all day for a $100,000 a year?”. He then clarified that he “was making a joke. No, we have not thought about that”. He later asked “What if our algorithm was far worse than random? Then if we hadn’t had run that experiment we basically are doing something terrible to all the users. Like, this is the only way to find this stuff out, if you guys have an alternative to the scientific method I’m all ears”. Rudder explained that the motivation for his blogpost was trying to kickstart a conversation around the acceptability of websites experimenting on users. “If you think that OKCupid has unlocked the mysteries of love and has an ironclad algorithm,” he said, “and prophetically can tell you exactly who is right for you, you’re a crazy. Y’know? “So, we’re doing our best, for sure, and it’s the same thing. I think people will realise that that’s how these sites work, that’s how they evolve, they’re doing the best job that they can, and they also have their own interests as well. And, and maybe that’s the process that we’re looking at. And that’s the kind of, again the kind of conversation that I think on accident, and OkCupid on purpose, is trying to kickstart.” Rudder had with a blogpost in late July detailing the ways in which OKCupid performed experiments to assess the value of its service. While the company is known for its use of data to improve its services, for many users the approach to experimentation – actively interfering with the site, as opposed to passively observing – was unsettling. “First, going on ‘a date you didn’t like’ isn’t a frivolous thing,” . “It definitely incurs more material costs than not seeing a Facebook status. And bad (or good) messages or a bad or good date can definitely have a bigger emotional impact as well. “More importantly, though, don’t make this just a question about dates or feelings, about what somebody did or didn’t read and what its effect on them was. I don’t care if you think someone making a dating profile is a frivolous thing. Somebody made that. They thought the company hosting it could be trusted to present it honestly. They were wrong.”	Technology
13288	13289	Pass the ketchup: World Cup 2014 players dip into favourite foods 	"Italy packed parmesan, olive oil and prosciutto; while the USA team brought oatmeal, Cheerios, peanut butter and A1 Steak Sauce. The Mexican squad, of course, required a little more spice. El Tri travelled with the ingredients for , along with chilli peppers, chipotle chillies and – cacti. When it comes to World Cup food, teams won't leave anything to chance. They expect their players to have top nutrition, and also want them to enjoy some favourites so they are comfortable and at their best when it's time to play. For the Italians, attention to culinary detail is nothing new. The Azzurri have always been particular about their pasta. ""Pasta is our preferred fuel, and before matches we play with the tricolore: pasta (white), tomato (red) and extra virgin olive oil (green),"" explained the team's nutritionist, Elisabetta Orsi, referring to the colours of Italy's flag. With everything else taking up suitcase space, the Italians left their bottled water back home this time because of the high cost of bringing it. For England, Roy Hodgson has lifted the ban on ketchup imposed by his predecessor as manager, Fabio Capello. Italy and USA have put a greater emphasis on nutrition under new coaches, each carefully planning meals with the guidance and direction of a dietitian or nutritionist and a chef. For Italy, even the medical staff may offer input to team chef Claudio Silvestri, who has his own TV commercials. Everything is planned carefully based on the climate, availability of fresh fruit and vegetables, and other conditions. Orsi said: ""Generally, the nutritionist establishes a dietary plan for the squad based on the type of training necessary match by match. The physicians are responsible for pointing out problems with individual players so the nutritionist can formulate a specific diet."" Long before the USA team travelled to Brazil this month, chef Bryson Billapando and sports performance dietitian Danielle LaFata (left) visited the team's hotels in São Paulo, Natal, Manaus and Recife to scour the kitchens and dining spaces and assess food options. Jürgen Klinsmann, the USA's team coach, loves a diet of fresh, organic vegetables – pesticide-free and flavoured with herbs and spices instead of fatty options such as butter and oil. Avocados are a must – the Americans go through an average of a case a day – and each meal includes two cooked vegetables featuring two colours, and players are encouraged to add more variety from fruit and the salad bar. There is also an emphasis on hydration and LaFata makes pre-workout energy shooter drinks, then blends individually designed smoothies for each player after games. She even makes a ""spa water"" with herbs and fruit to reduce the juice intake. The 5ft LaFata She pulls around a cooler on wheels that's nearly as big as she is, filled with fresh fruit. ""They're big juice drinkers,"" she said coffee limit is three cups per day. Even the substitutes exert themselves during warm-ups before and during matches. Billapando said: ""The level we want to take this to, it's going to be as high as we can take it because we never know what that 1% might be that takes us to the championship."" The teams' care with food is a wise precaution. Last month, a Brazilian consumer group said it had found food past its expiry date in the hotels where the Italy and England teams are staying."

8838	8839	Ukip confirms immigration policy is 'under review' 	"Ukip has confirmed that its policy on immigration, one of its strongest selling points at the polls, is ""under review"". A party spokesman also accepted that it may increase the cap it has previously backed of 50,000 people moving to the UK a year. Ukip in its 2010 manifesto said: ""We aspire to ensure that any future immigration does not exceed 50,000 people per annum."" All three mainstream parties are promising to put Ukip policy under renewed scrutiny. Michael Gove, the education secretary, promised there would be civilised scrutiny, adding that Ukip had a black hole in its spending commitments of £120bn. Eric Pickles, the communities secretary, claimed Ukip was already looking uncomfortable on specifics of its immigration policy. The Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, on Friday continued to offer a broad-brush analysis, saying that in the past 10 years there had been more migrants into Britain than between 1066 and 1950. Ukip's manifesto on its is more specific, saying that at present immigration is adding 1 million people to the population every four to five years. The outline policy includes a promise to introduce a five-year freeze on immigration for permanent settlement until UK borders are under control. The party has said there would be exceptions, but has not yet said how many. It has also said over-staying on a visa would become a criminal offence. Immigrants would not be able to apply for public housing or benefits until they had paid tax for five years. It adds: ""Any future immigration for permanent settlement must be on a strictly limited and controlled basis where that can clearly be shown to benefit the British people as a whole and our economy."" No definition of this is provided. Ukip also says it would ""enable people to come and work in the UK by means of a points-based work permit system for limited periods of time and to fulfil specific gaps in the job market that cannot be filled by the existing work force"". No detail is given. It offers a form of amnesty, saying ""EU citizens who have been established in the UK for seven years or more will, depending on their circumstances, be able to apply for permanent leave to remain (provided they fulfil certain criteria and are eligible to apply for work permits)"". Ukip also adds it would leave the European convention of human rights and the European convention on refugees."	Politics
1965	1966	The Boy Next Door review – Jennifer Lopez suffers reverse Fatal Attraction 	ude, you GOTTA read The Iliad.” So encourages Noah Sandborn, the titular boy next door, surprisingly versed in Greek literature for someone who seems more growth hormone than man. Sandborn is played by Ryan Guzman, introduced bicep-first when he glides into frame to help his neighbour with a wonky garage door. That neighbour is the newly separated mother and high school classics teacher Claire Peterson, played by the sexy-but-still-comfortably-attired . As we learn in a choppy opening sequence more befitting a TV episode recap than a feature film, Claire recently tossed her philandering husband Garrett (John Corbett) out of the house. Occasional meals and fishing trips with their son Kevin (Ian Nelson) keeps the not-yet-ex around a bit, and Claire’s nights on the singles’ scene aren’t so great. (On a blind date, a mean “businessman” confronts Claire and her liberal arts kind for not grooming kids to have “useful skills”.) Maybe Claire should just forgive her wayward husband, or maybe she should focus on being the best individual she can be, but what she definitely shouldn’t do is make goo-goo eyes at the new hunk across the way, especially if she is in that peach-colored silk chemise and he’s in nothing but the cut marble that is his shirtlessness. In time, they mate. But the morning after, Claire expresses intense regret, accepts responsibility as “the adult” and says it was a mistake. Why the guilt? Well, even though actor Ryan Guzman is 27 and looks it, when the class bell rings tomorrow we in the audience learn that he’s actually a new transfer senior and (hold on to your binders) now he’s in her class. What follows is an amusing reverse Fatal Attraction. He shows up and makes coarse innuendos. He gifts Claire with a “first edition” of The Iliad (which, alas, isn’t a papyrus scroll or an orator from ancient history intoning Homer’s great yarn. I don’t know what the hell they mean by “first edition”, frankly, but Claire, despite wanting to distance herself from Noah, coos appreciatively). He’s suddenly the best pal of her dorky son, teaching him to box and to shoot oranges with a gun. The more Claire pushes him away (and the more Garrett seems to be rejoining the family), the more obsessed Noah becomes. Somehow, he seemed to know this might happen even before the pair fell to their passion that one night, as he videotaped their more-than-PG-13-but-not-very-R-rated peccadillo. In time he’s threatening her job by going public with evidence of their dalliance. Eventually this leads to violence and heroics and even Kristin Chenoweth (Claire’s boss/BFF) getting bonked on the head and tied up with rope. Alas, other than one crafty camera move that boasts a gloriously ridiculous “he’s hiding behind the potted plant” reveal, there isn’t much of a visual stamp on the whole picture. It feels rushed, bland and cheap. Not only that, but its ancient Greek metaphors slip too easily from Homer to Sophocles. There is no doubt that certain sophisticated audiences will find mirth in the campiness, preferably while watching this at home with ample glass of white zinfandel. The problem is that they’ll somewhat be projecting their hopes onto the screen. The Boy Next Door is bad, but it isn’t THAT bad. It isn’t Showgirls bad, which really is a pity. No one could ever accuse Jennifer Lopez of being a great thespian, but she isn’t chewing those leather-bound first editions on her shelf either. Those who delight in seeing our cultural divas in any state of dramatic extreme will have a great time, but for a would-be cult classic, this could have been much more. So instead we’ll just stay up late at night with an unquenchable longing, knowing that somewhere out there is a trashier version of cougar J-Lo versus the meaty young Achilles-quoting hunk who doesn’t understand when he’s dumped.

9440	9441	US box office: Neighbors borrows Spider-Man 2's sugar 	Universal Pictures bolstered its already impressive comedy credentials with a No 1 debut for Neighbors (known as in the UK) that smashed The Amazing Spider-Man 2 in its second weekend. The estimated $51m (£30.18m) debut from 3,279 theatres puts Neighbors on course to cross $100m (£59.18m) with no comedy to challenge it until Seth MacFarlane's A Million Ways to Die in the West arrives on 30 May. The launch took some sting out of rival comedy , too, and bolstered Universal's credentials as a solid purveyor of stoner treats in the wake of 2012's Ted, while their comedy back catalogue includes hit Apatow productions such as Bridesmaids, Knocked Up and Funny People. That Neighbors built up a head of steam is beyond doubt and hats off to the comedy for usurping former box-office champ Spidey. However, the fact that has only taken $147.9m (£87.5m) after two weekends does not bode well for its long-term prospects. By the same stage the 2012 prequel had reached $200.5m (£118.6m) en route to $262m (£115m) and on this showing Spidey 2 is by no means guaranteed to get near that number. Conversely, has smashed past the final tally of its 2011 predecessor. That film ended on $176.7m (£104.5m) in November 2011. At this rate, Winter Soldier will cross $250m (£147.9m) with ease. Good news for a movie that has already been hailed as one of the best from Marvel stable. Marvel executives, along with suits from parent company Disney, will be licking their lips at the thought of the third episode. , Jon Favreau's drama about a cook who returns to his roots and launches a food cart, has been described as heartwarming by some critics and certainly dished out a result that will make its distributor feel all tingly inside.

3151	3152	Former Commerzbank bankers should be paid bonuses from 2008, says court 	"A four-year legal battle by 104 London-based bankers who argued they should be paid €52m (£44m) by Germany's Commerzbank took another twist on Friday when the court of appeal ruled that they should be paid the bonuses from 2008. However, Germany's second biggest bank immediately said it was ""considering its legal options"" and legal experts said it could turn to the supreme court to attempt to overturn the judgment, which relates to its attempt to stop bonuses during the banking crisis. The row dates back to the banking crisis, when Commerzbank took over its rival Dresdner Kleinwort and cut the bonuses of staff as it scrambled for survival amid mounting losses which reached €6bn. In , the court ruled that the bonuses should be paid as there was binding contract that had been put in place to avoid a mass departure of staff when Dresdner's original owners, Allianz, had decided to spin off the investment bank. A bonus pool of €400m had been in put in place by Allianz to try to prevent the bankers walking away even as the losses were mounting. But after Commerzbank bank took over Dresdner in 2009 it put in a ""material adverse change"" clause into contracts and scaled back the bonuses. Commerzbank took the decision to the court of appeal, after originally being denied the right to appeal, where a judgment handed down on Friday ruled in favour of the bankers. Clive Zietman, head of commercial litigation at Stewarts Law, which represents 83 of the bankers, said: ""This is not just a victory for my clients. It is a triumph for common sense and for some very well-established principles of English contract law. It is a great pity that the bank saw fit to contest so vigorously and for so long, a case that could so easily have been avoided."" Mark Levine, partner at Mishcon de Reya, solicitor to 21 of the claimants, also welcomed the decision. But as Commerzbank is frustrated that courts in other jurisdictions such as , Italy, Japan and New York have upheld its decision to withhold bonuses, other lawyers said that the case could yet continue. Andreas White, employment law partner at Kingsley Napley, said Commerzbank ""is bound to attempt an appeal to the supreme court"". Commerzbank, bailed out by German taxpayers during the crisis, said it was ""disappointed with the decision"". ""It is a regrettable outcome in view of the on-going regulatory, public and shareholder calls to establish a sound relationship between banks' performance and variable remuneration,"" Commerzbank said. Other legal experts said it would present problems for bankers in discussing pay policies with staff in the future. Paul Quain, partner at GQ Employment Law, said: ""Banks are now discouraged from using group methods for communicating with staff, such as town hall meetings which had become increasingly popular prior to the high court decision. They won't want to risk inadvertently making expensive binding promises to large numbers of staff"". The latest ruling follows a case where it was ruled that a City banker – Latifa Bouabdillah – was ""victimised"" by Commerzbank after it discovered she was suing her former employer for sexual discrimination. But the tribunal rejected a sexual discrimination charge she had brought after she was sacked when Commerzbank discovered she was suing her former employer, Deutsche Bank, for more than £1m in damages."

The videos, which are edited, dubbed or montaged, are intended to be humorous and mostly satirical, and often poke fun at celebrities or politicians. The issue of copyright, however, has seen many spoofs pulled from the internet. Changes to the law will allow parodists to use copyrighted material, as spoofs will now fall under “fair dealing”.

15135	15136	Suffragette review: historical drama tub-thumps hard despite having your vote 	he battle to secure the vote for women in England in the first part of the last century is probably not one with which you’d struggle to sympathise. Of course many successful movies - Lincoln, Selma, almost anything about the second world war – involve conflicts about which the audience comes pre-converted, there to enjoy the preacher. And yet there’s something about the treatment meted out to history here which extracts tension from the battle. Almost everyone who doesn’t see eye-to-eye with our freedom fighters is a boorish sex pest, a cowardly prig or an ignorant fool. No arguments from the other side are presented which aren’t intended to invite 21st century eye-rolling. The filter throughout is hindsight. Given this, then, director Sarah Gavron does well to galvanize her story with a degree of urgency: the result of swift, assured camerawork and a brilliantly understated performance by . Mulligan is Maud, a fictionalised character drawn to the movement less through political engagement than bubbling frustration at her lot. She works in a laundry, has done since she was a child, lives in a tiny flat with husband and co-worker Ben Whishaw (for whom the model seems to be Lee, Dawn’s fiancee in The Office) and their young son. When a friend can’t testify to parliament about the plight of working women on account of being beaten up by her husband, Maud takes her place. And the opportunity to have her voice heard unlocks an anger which finds release in activism. But comes at quite a price. Mulligan’s face is alive with all the subtlety the film around her sometimes lacks. At the start, her star wattage is muted; her eyes catch fire as she finds purpose in her work, even as her family life falls apart. That she wrings tears from you in one - albeit slightly shameless - scene feels quite an achievement. Helena Bonham Carter (as an educated chemist) and Anne-Marie Duff (chirpy cockney) acquit themselves fine but their characters are much less developed than Mulligan’s. Yet smaller is the cameo of as Emmeline Pankhurst; neat casting but ultimately not notable. Mulligan has previously worked with scriptwriter on Steve McQueen’s Shame; this screenplay is much more like Morgan’s for Gavron’s first film, Brick Lane, with a third act swing into Hunger-territory, as the women are incarcerated and try to protest in prison. A few exchanges between Mulligan and Brendan Gleeson’s sceptical detective come close to crackling, but some of the dialogue employs more wordplay than feels credible (“If they want us to respect the law, they need to make the law respectable”). Exposition treads heavy at times, too: “The movement is divided. Even Sylvia Pankhurst is opposed to her mother and sister’s militant strategy.” The film is at its best in conveying the claustrophobia of repression, the mushrooming realisation some grievances are impossible to swallow. There is a little debate about the ethics of direct action, but it’s swiftly resolved (“We will win,” says Maud, helpfully). Perhaps it’s unfair to hope a strictly historical movie might try to chime louder with the present day, but there feels a missed opportunity here not so much in touching base with the current state of women’s rights but the merits of martyrdom – not to mention the manner fundamentalist recruitment. But doesn’t just exist on its own terms, but in its own time, too; it’s a peculiarly hermetic watch - the first world war, for instance, goes unmentioned. Gavron has made a decent film with near horizons, a civil disobedience picture that’s not as politely produced as you’d think. But a classic? I abstain.	Film
2944	2945	Lobbying bill passes through House of Lords 	"Charities have expressed their disappointment after the government's controversial lobbying bill squeezed through the on Tuesday, despite fears it could limit freedom of speech in the run-up to an election. Many voluntary groups and trade unions have been campaigning against the legislation, branding it the ""gagging bill"", because it would put new restrictions on how much they can spend while campaigning on political issues before an election. Ministers were forced to back down in several areas after peers rejected key parts of the legislation. Graham Allen, the Labour MP in charge of scrutinising the bill, accused ministers of presenting a ""dog's breakfast"". But on Tuesday the government won votes on two amendments and tied on another, meaning the bulk of the original proposal will pass into law. In a last-ditch attempt to frustrate the bill, Lord Harries, who chairs the Commission on Civil Society and Democratic Engagement representing more than 100 groups, warned it would be a ""bureaucratic nightmare"" and accused ministers of imposing a ""huge regulatory burden on campaigning groups"". Liz Hutchins, senior campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said it was a ""bad day for anyone wanting to protect the environment, save a hospital or oppose tuition fees"". Sir Stephen Bubb, chief executive of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations (ACEVO), added that the matter ""does not finish today"". ""ACEVO will be monitoring the impact of the bill,"" he said. ""We'll be asking our members how the legislation affects their work. We'll work closely with our members to give advice on its implications. And we'll continue to agitate for political parties to revise this bad bill in light of our evidence after the 2015 election. ""We must be clear: civil society must never lose its voice. We must stand up for our beliefs and refuse self-censorship. ACEVO will work tirelessly to ensure that this Bill does not gag charities and campaigners."" Lord Wallace of Tankerness, deputy Lords leader, denied the requirement would be ""burdensome,"" and insisted most staff costs would be excluded from campaigning limits. The government argues very few third party organisations will be caught up by the new laws."	Politics

9509	9510	Interstellar science 'deliberately speculative' says Christopher Nolan 	Christopher Nolan has defended the science behind his blockbuster space drama, , while admitting that many of the phenomena in the movie are deliberately speculative. In an , Nolan was asked to comment on criticism of his film’s depiction of interplanetary space travel. Both professional and amateur critics, , have hinted that the film has as many plot holes as wormholes, but Nolan said he was comfortable with Interstellar’s scientific credibility. “My films are always held to a weirdly high standard … [that] isn’t applied to everybody else’s films, which I’m fine with,” said Nolan. “People are always accusing my films of having plot holes. And I’m very aware of the plot holes in my films and very aware of when people spot them – but they generally don’t.” The film-maker worked closely with theoretical physicist Dr Kip Thorne when developing Interstellar. Nolan admitted “cheating” on the science for the sake of the audience’s enjoyment on occasion, but said critics should read Thorne’s book . One criticism from multiple quarters has been the film’s suggestion that during one hour that Nolan’s astronaut visits the exoplanets seven hours would pass on Earth. “That’s completely accurate,” the British director said. “Those issues are all buttoned-up,” he added, saying that Thorne’s book about the film distinguishes between the accurate science and the speculation. Nolan added: “There have been a bunch of knee-jerk tweets by people who’ve only seen the film once, but to really take on the science of the film, you’re going to need to sit down with the film for a bit and probably also read Kip’s book.” Meanwhile, in a boost to his scientific credibility, the tech magazine Wired , following in the footsteps of film-makers such as James Cameron and JJ Abrams.

5183	5184	Ericsson sues Apple to block iPhone and iPad sales in the US over patents 	Swedish telecoms firm Ericsson has filed seven new lawsuits against Apple and a complaint with the US international trade commission (ITC) in an attempt to block the sale of the . The lawsuits filed in Texas allege Apple’s infringement of 41 different Ericsson patents covering the technologies integral to 2G, 3G and 4G mobile connection standards. “Apple’s products benefit from the technology invented and patented by Ericsson’s engineers. We are committed to sharing our innovations and have acted in good faith to find a fair solution,” said Kasim Alfalahi, chief intellectual property officer at Ericsson. “Apple currently uses our technology without a licence and therefore we are seeking help from the court and the ITC.” The spat over patents arose when Apple’s licence agreement with Ericsson expired in mid-January. Renewal talks stalled leading to lawsuits from both companies. But the complaints with the ITC from Ericsson have escalated the dispute putting pressure on Apple. The ITC has the power to block products from entering the US, and as Apple’s iPhone, iPad and most Mac computers are made in China it could stop importing and selling them in its home country. Apple filed a lawsuit on 12 January claiming that Ericsson’s LTE patents were not essential to industry standards and that the Swedish firm’s demands were excessive, accusing the company of “abusive licensing practices”. Ericsson responded with its own suit. The lawsuits sought a court ruling over whether Ericsson’s patent royalty demands were fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory given the fundamental nature of the technology for mobile devices. “Ericsson made several attempts to find a fair solution, including an offer for both parties to be bound by a decision on fair licensing terms by a US federal court. Apple has refused all attempts,” in a statement. Analysts have predicted that an Ericsson victory could cost Apple between $250m and $750m annually. Ericsson’s 35,000-plus intellectual property portfolio was estimated to be worth $1.18bn in 2014. The company has over 100 patent licensing agreements with mobile technology companies and is the largest manufacturer of network equipment. “We’ve always been willing to pay a fair price to secure the rights to standards essential patents covering technology in our products. Unfortunately, we have not been able to agree with Ericsson on a fair rate for their patents so, as a last resort, we are asking the courts for help,” said an Apple spokeswoman at the time of its lawsuit in January. Apple declined to comment further.	Technology
12840	12841	Cameron hails plan to fast-track devolution for English cities 	The prime minister has welcomed an ambitious proposal to devolve power to UK city regions along the same brisk timetable as the Scottish devolution process, suggesting and West Yorkshire could gain more autonomy in 2015. The from the City Growth Commission argues that devolution from Whitehall to city regions will boost economic output in the UK’s 15 largest metropolitan areas (“metros”) by £79bn per year – approaching 5% of current GDP. It also proposes a vastly improved transport network in the north of England across the Pennines, including a northern answer to London’s Oyster card – dubbed the “Noyster”. Praising the report as “absolutely first class”, told Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday that there was a “real opportunity” to rebalance the economy using high speed rail and other infrastructure to “link up our great northern cities” and create a “northern powerhouse”. The City Growth Commission says an independent committee should be established to draw up plans for what it calls “devo met”. This would run in parallel to the led by former foreign secretary William Hague, which is trying to reach a constitutional settlement to give Scotland more autonomy following the referendum. The “devo met” group should draw up draft legislation for enabling powers by January 2015, just as Hague’s will. That would allow any financial and/or fiscal settlement to be a central part of the 2015 comprehensive spending review, according to the report’s authors. The City Growth Commission is led by Mancunian Jim O’Neill, the outgoing chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management and a confidant of the chancellor, George Osborne. Speaking at the report’s launch at the RSA in London on Wednesday, O’Neill cheerfully accused Osborne of “stealing” many of the commission’s ideas when setting out his vision this summer of a “ ” made up of interconnected cities along the M62 corridor – a region of seven million people referred to as ManSheffLeedsPool by O’Neill. Osborne has made clear that handing power and money to the most competent local authorities and universities will be at the heart of his autumn statement in December. O’Neill’s report argues that cities, particularly those in the north of England, need to get over their rivalries and work together if they are to be entrusted with more power over spending. While the report was welcomed by business people and political leaders in the 15 “metros” singled out in the report (London, Greater , West Midlands, West Yorkshire, Glasgow, Merseyside, Tyne and Wear, South Yorkshire, East Midlands, South Hampshire, Edinburgh, Cardiff, Bristol, Belfast and Leicester), others were less impressed. Stephen Brady, leader of Hull city council, said: “I’m really, really disappointed that Hull once again has been overlooked in favour of the bigger cities. We’re like the forgotten city, despite being strategically so important. The population of Hull is 265,000, but if you add in East Riding it’s at least half a million. of investment in the last year, including the new Siemens wind turbine plant and the Reckitt-Benckiser research and development facility. We’ve won the City of Culture 2017 bid. What else can we do to prove that we want to be given the chance to run things ourselves?” Marco Cereste, leader of Peterborough city council, said he had been lobbying O’Neill’s team all year to argue “big isn’t always beautiful”. “I think that small cities can implement new ideas quicker, more effectively and probably more effectively than big cities. What I don’t want is for London to be hugely successful south of us, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds successful above us, sucking the life out of in the middle.” Colin Glover, leader of Carlisle council, said his city faced being squeezed by an ever more powerful north-west and north-east England, with getting more powers just eight miles to the north. “There’s a general feeling that Carlisle isn’t seen as having the same status as some of the big cities, which gives me some cause for concern. We need to make a lot of noise to make sure we are not forgotten,” he said. Richard Carter, leader of Yorkshire First, a political party which wants independence for God’s Own County, dismissed O’Neill’s proposals as “divisive, undemocratic and limited.” He said: “Yorkshire is its cities, towns and villages. We don’t see any advantage in creating islands of devolution in Yorkshire. By concentrating on a limited number of ‘metro areas’, places like Hull, the East Riding and North miss out.” The new report, called , says that apart from London, only Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire are currently ready for substantial devolution. Both currently have a “fiscal gap” – a discrepancy between their attributable tax revenues and their level of public expenditure. Greater Manchester – the UK’s second largest metro area, with a population of 2,894,240 according to the 2011 census – takes £4bn–5bn more from the Treasury than it contributes. But the report argues that such underperformance could be addressed by entrusting these city regions with big budget and policymaking flexibilities: to be handed more control over housebuilding, planning and transport, as well as a string of property taxes, better rail links and super-fast broadband. Speaking at the report’s launch, Lord Heseltine, former deputy prime minister and , said the Scottish referendum had shown that the public are fed up with so much power being centralised in Whitehall. “The agenda is centre stage. The time is now. There is no way in which, in my view, the House of Commons is going to pass Scottish devolution processes unless there is a fair settlement for England of a devolutionary nature,” he said, adding: “The country will gain immeasurably from a determined attempt to achieve this new way of running the country. I say ‘new way’, but we actually did run this country that way when we became the great imperial power that we are.”	Politics
12663	12664	Lonmin mine in South Africa hit by fresh violence 	"Violence has returned to the mine where 34 miners were shot dead by South African police earlier this month. Police on Monday reported a fresh outbreak of assaults at the platinum mine owned by the London-listed company, which is considering an emergency rights issue in the wake of the dispute. A long-running rivalry between miners' unions reignited four days after a memorial service to remember the 44 people who have died during a fortnight of violence at Lonmin's Marikana mine near Johannesburg. Striking miners, who are demanding a tripling of their pay, threatened and assaulted other workers as they attempted to go back down the mine, according to reports from the scene. Alfonso Mofokeng, a miner from Lesotho, told the AFP news agency: ""We are aware that some people have gone back to work, we have noted that behaviour, and we need to come up with a plan to deal with them."" Lonmin, which had been hoping to restart production on Monday after a two week shutdown due to the violent protest, said 13% of its 28,000 workers reported for duty. The company said many of its miners were unable to get to work after the protesters threatened bus drivers. ""There have been incidents of intimidation towards bus drivers overnight as well as intimidation of Eastern workers this morning, preventing them coming to work,"" a company spokesman said. Until now, the eastern part of Marikana's operation had remained relatively free of violence. On Monday, about 2,000 of the striking rock drillers, some carrying sticks and whips, gathered near the site of the ""Marikana massacre"" where police shot dead 34 striking miners in the worst single outbreak of police violence since the end of apartheid. Five armoured police vehicles and a helicopter were monitoring the situation. The striking miners are demanding their wages are increased from 4,000 rand (£306) a month to 12,500 rand. The company says most workers are paid about 10,500 rand, if bonuses are included. In comparison, Lonmin's chief executive Ian Farmer, who is currently seriously ill in hospital, collected pay and bonuses of £1.2m last year. Last week, Lonmin promoted its finance director Simon Scott to acting chief executive until Farmer recovers. The FTSE100 mining company also admitted that it would breach its loan covenants due to the financial impact of the strike, forcing it into talks with its banking syndicate as it considers an emergency rights issue. The South African independent police investigative directorate said it was investigating claims that more than 100 striking miners were assaulted in police custody. About 260 miners have appeared in court facing charges ranging from intimidation to murder."	Business

But the finding was denounced as a ""complete and utter whitewash"" by the Conservative MP Anne Main, who complained to No 10 after learning that the 2011 lunch included discussion of a controversial planning application by the developers Helioslough for a rail freight depot on green belt land in her St Albans constituency. In a letter to Main, the cabinet secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, said Villiers – now Northern Ireland secretary – had assured him the lunch with Helioslough's chief lobbyist Simon Hoare was ""a personal engagement with a long-standing friend"", and that she did not take any action as a result or pass on the content of their discussion to officials or ministers in the transport or communities departments. He said: ""This is a position that has been supported by accounts from both departments and I have absolutely no reason to doubt these accounts."" He added: ""Having considered this matter in full, I believe that both departments acted properly in respect of the planning appeal and that there is no evidence that decisions were affected by lobbying on behalf of Helioslough or other parties."" But the St Albans MP said Heywood had failed to address the provision in the code governing ministers' behaviour which requires them not only to avoid conflicts of interest between their public duties and private interests, but also to ensure that no such conflict ""could reasonably be perceived to arise""."

12643	12644	Film review: The Curious Case of Benjamin Button 	"emove ""curious"" from the title and replace it with ""twee and pointless"", and you're close to it. What a incredible shaggy-puppy of a movie, a cobweb-construction patched together with CGI, prosthetics, gibberish and warm tears. And, at two hours and 40 minutes, it really does go on for an incredibly long time. David Fincher directs this adaptation, by screenwriter Eric Roth, of a minor 1921 story by F Scott Fitzgerald. The idea is that Benjamin Button - a name that, incidentally, does not get any less annoying as the minutes and hours drag by - is an Everyman-ish sort of fellow who is born in New Orleans just after the end of the first world war and lives until his late 80s. The weird thing is that he emerges from the womb a tiny shrivelled old man and gets younger and younger until he becomes super-gorgeous . Then he dwindles to a boy and a baby again, unlined this time. As a wizened geezer-munchkin at the beginning of his strange existence, Button is to meet Daisy, a clear-eyed, auburn-haired little girl with whom he has an instant connection that is not at all creepy or paedophilic. This girl, a brilliant ballet dancer, grows up to be Cate Blanchett; as their ages converge, Daisy and Benjamin have a brief, passionate love affair, before the contra-flow of time takes them away from each other: ships that pass in the night. Before they finally consummate their love, however, there are a number of false starts. At first, the callow and conceited Daisy wants to jump into bed with wise old Benjamin because she likes the idea of doing it with an older man. He gently demurs, but years later, when the slightly younger Benjamin shyly shows up backstage at her triumphant New York show, she is far too cool and famous to spend time with him. It is only after she has been crippled in a car crash - humbled, in fact, like the blinded Mr Rochester in Jane Eyre - that Daisy is spiritually ready for the privilege of a relationship with winsome Benjamin Button. The idea of Button getting younger and younger is not imbued with any great comic or tragic insight. Or any insight at all. He is not like Dracula or Dorian Gray. He is just bland-faced Benjamin Button, who eventually, in his youthful pomp, riding his motorcycle or sailing his yacht, has all the interest of a model in a Gap advert. Apart from his remarkable physical quirk, which never attracts any medical or media attention, Benjamin really is very boring indeed. You could change the story's concept to, say, gravity working the opposite way around for Benjamin, causing him to bob around up on the ceiling with everyone else milling around on the floor, and that empty, beefcake expression of pure existential zilch wouldn't be any different. He also has a Zelig-type habit of showing up at important events: while he's sailing in Florida, you can see Apollo 11 taking off in the distance. ""Oh my God, look over there everyone!"" I wanted to shout. ""Something interesting is happening!"" Benjamin has learned nothing of any great note on his backward journey through life, and remains placidly incurious about his condition; even the imminent tragic departure from Daisy does not elicit so much as a tear. In the intellectual stakes, this guy makes Forrest Gump look like Karl Popper. The technical trickery used to make characters look older than they are is certainly impressive, particularly for the ancient Daisy on her hospital deathbed. But the way it makes the actors look younger, in their early 20s, is very strange. Both Cate and Brad's skin is digitally tweaked to look eerily smooth all over the face and up to the eyes, like state-of-the-art remedial work on a burns victim. The sheer, undifferentiated flesh has a metallic sheen; it looks as if it would ring if you tapped it. They don't look like youngsters as such, more like robot-replicants from Planet Westworld. The only entirely real-looking face is that of Julia Ormond, playing Daisy's grown-up daughter, reading aloud to her dying mother from Benjamin's preposterous autobiographical journal - erm, when is he supposed to have written this? - a supercilious device that triggers the film's flashback structure. For all the apparent mirror-world strangeness, this is just another syrupy-sentimental nostalgiafest from the south, for which Hollywood has always found a lucrative market among older audiences, like the novels of Fannie Flagg. In fact, the movie it reminded me of was Nick Cassavetes's The Notebook, a treacly tale starring buttery oldsters James Garner and Gena Rowlands. David Fincher, the director of Se7en, Fight Club and Zodiac brings nothing dark to this material, and nothing really distinctive at all, although he couldn't be a safer pair of hands. But this film's combination of soupy love-story and undemanding tricksiness appears to have hit the spot, with 13 Oscar nominations. Maybe it's a wish-fulfilment fantasy for thousands of Hollywood execs, who dream that as the years go by, ever increasing cash and power is making them more and more youthfully handsome."	Film

8008	8009	UK supermarkets face mounting pressure to cut food waste 	"British supermarkets are coming under increasing pressure to go further than rival to show shoppers what progress they are making in reducing food waste, as the government insists that such action should remain voluntary. Green campaigners have called on all major supermarkets to put an end to multi-buy deals and other marketing tools which result in customers wasting millions of tonnes of fresh food – much of it still edible – every year. The announcement on Monday by the UK's largest supermarket that it was dropping some food promotions after – and revealing food waste data for its operations for the first time – was broadly welcomed. Environmental campaigners and charities, however, said they amounted to only ""baby"" and ""tentative"" steps and urged all retailers to go further. Tesco revealed that 68% of bagged salad was thrown out – 35% of it in the home. It also found that 40% of apples were wasted, and just under half of bakery items. The supermarket tracked 25 bestselling products and combined information with data from the government's waste reduction advisory body, Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap), to give an overall food waste ""footprint"" for each item. In the first six months of this year, 28,500 tonnes of food waste were generated in Tesco's stores and distribution centres. Annual figures from Wrap show that, in total, 15m tonnes of food are discarded each year in the UK, with households responsible for nearly half the waste. Of this, almost 4m tonnes are thrown away despite being edible. The announcement follows earlier this year to use its size and clout to reduce the amount of food wasted by its customers and elsewhere in its international supply chain. Friends of the Earth food campaigner Vicki Hird said: ""Tesco is the largest food retailer in the UK. It is responsible for far too much of the UK waste food mountain which means wasted water, energy and land. ""The supermarket needs to go much further than these baby steps to tackle the huge waste it causes in its operations, such as over-ordering and demanding cosmetic perfection, and via marketing. All retailers should stop multi-buy deals and other marketing tools which lead to customers wasting fresh food."" Hird highlighted the enormous ""hidden"" energy, water and land costs of producing food – particularly meat and dairy products – and said there should be a national drive to slash food waste to zero. She urged retailers ""to clearly change their buying practices, marketing strategies and demand for cosmetically perfect produce and also help farmers and customers towards that goal"". The Department for Environment, and Rural Affairs (Defra) oversees food and waste reduction through the third phase of the Courtauld Commitment – a voluntary agreement with the grocery and retail sector to cut both food and packaging waste in the supply chain, which was launched this spring. A Defra spokeswoman said: ""We are determined to support food retailers, industry and consumers in their efforts to reduce food waste but we do not believe in mandatory targets. The voluntary agreement with the retail grocery and manufacturing sectors sets ambitious targets for businesses but gives them the flexibility on how to meet them in the most cost-effective way."" Alice Ellison, environmental policy adviser at the British Retail Consortium, said retailers took such commitments seriously and had reduced waste in the supply chain by 8.8% since 2009. ""While cutting waste in the supply chain is important, these figures make clear that reducing household food waste will deliver the greatest gains for the environment, and this is another area in which food retailers have made significant progress."" She said food retailers and manufacturers had recently committed to cutting household food waste by 20% from 2005-15. Large volumes of food past its ""best by"" and ""use by"" dates which might have once been sent straight to landfill was run by charities such as FareShare and the Trussell Trust. Hannah Stoddard, head of economic justice policy at Oxfam, said: ""Wasting this amount of food when almost a billion people go hungry every day and record numbers in the UK are using food banks, is nothing short of a scandal. It is a damning indictment of a food system that places greater importance on corporate profits than ensuring everyone has enough to eat. ""It's great news that the biggest supermarket in Britain is taking tentative steps to tackle the problem, but we need urgent action like greater regulation and investment from governments worldwide to fix the system."" Of the other major supermarkets, Marks & Spencer pointed to the progress it had made under its ""Plan A"" ethical and environmental programme, launched in 2007, with the aim of sending no waste to landfill by 2012. It said that for the 2012-13 financial year, the total amount of food waste it produced was down by 32% against 2008-09. ""This reduction is partly because we now sell short-life food products at a discount to our customers. In this year, we sold an estimated 60% of the food products that would have otherwise gone to waste at a reduced price. ""Most of our food waste (89%) is sent to anaerobic digestion and the remainder reused in other ways (including working with FareShare) – nothing goes to landfill."""	Business

Jonathan Glazer's extraordinary piece of outsider art – the director's first feature since 2004's Birth – was greeted at Venice by an even split of cheering and boos. A pox on the cat-callers; they can boo themselves hoarse. Under the Skin is far and away the best picture in the competition so far: a story that plays as a kind of malarial dream, bathed in cold sweat and seeing hallucinations in every corner. Johansson proves bizarrely engrossing as the unnamed succubus, fetchingly augmented with jet-black hair and blood-red lipstick, who drives a van around Scotland in search of her prey. The men she meets are bored and horny and can't believe their good fortune. The alien duly lures them in with polite, persistent questions, barely pausing to hear the replies. Then she ushers each man down the steps into a pool of viscid fluid where they spot the bodies of former victims, floating naked in the gloom like Bluebeard's wives. We are never told where this alien is from or what she's doing, exactly, although the film takes its lead from . Slice it open and one realises that Under the Skin is actually a hybrid of two hackneyed film genres. It's indebted on the one side to the psychosexual horror movie in which feckless, lusty youths receive their comeuppance and, on the other, to those fish-out-of-water capers (like ET, or even Splash) about kooky visitors from the wide blue yonder. And yet the director works a magic on this material. He takes tired old prose and spins it into poetry. In a perfect world, Glazer would win the top prize on Sunday and not have to wait another nine years before he makes his next film. But we do not live in a perfect world, and Under the Skin is perhaps best viewed as an icy parable of love, sex and loneliness. The director leads us between empty seashores and cacophonous nightclubs. He turns a hidden camera on the streets of Scotland and watches unnoticed as the people shop and smoke and tap out their texts. Increasingly, it seems, Johansson wants to find a place in this throng. But try as she might, she can't quite fit. The TV set is a mystery, and the slice of chocolate cake only sticks in her throat. Driving on the road, she encounters a fellow pariah, a young man with a bone deformity, who shops by night and has no friends. A little later we shall see this figure again, wandering naked and bewildered on the outskirts of town, just another lost soul who's in search of a home.	Film
1463	1464	Google allows Europeans to ask for links to be removed 	"At least 12,000 people have signed an online form asking Google to remove links about them from their search results in only 24 hours since it offered the service. activists have cautiously welcomed Google's decision to provide the form for Europeans to make the request. Chief executive Larry Page said was ""trying now to be more European, and think about [data collection] maybe more from a European context"". The firm says it has received a surge of data removal requests since a , Europe's highest court, which said search engines were subject to data protection rules and so should remove ""outdated, wrong or irrelevant"" information from their indexes unless there was a public interest in keeping it. About 40% of the requests have come from Germany and 13% from the UK, Google told the FT. The biggest proportion of removal requests, about 31%, related to frauds and scams. Google said it had set up a where people can request the removal of particular links, though it does not commit to removing them within any time limit. Decisions will be made by people, not algorithms, and information will start to be removed from mid-June. Although links to articles will be removed, the ECJ ruling says the original articles can remain. Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, which campaigns for privacy and free speech, said: ""There are clear privacy issues from time to time about material published on the web. To actually have a mechanism to deal with this seems to be the right way to go."" The ECJ ruling did not specify how Google and other search engines should weigh up user requests, saying only that they should balance the needs of data privacy and public interest – for example relating to politicians seeking to have information about themselves removed. Page : ""I wish we'd been more involved in a real debate in Europe. That's one of the things we've taken from this, that we're starting the process of really going and talking to people."" Google will also set up a 10-strong committee of senior executives and outside experts who will try to develop a long-term approach to requests. Among those already named are Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, UN special rapporteur Frank La Rue, University of Leuven director Peggy Valcke, the former Spanish data protection chief Jose Luis Pinar, and Luciano Floridi, information ethics philospher at the Oxford Institute. The web form only applies to searches in . In the US, the first amendment means that freedom of speech and publication trump data protection rights, which are minimal. Dina Shiloh, of the law firm Mishcon de Reya, who has advised companies and individuals over online reputation management, called the move ""baby steps"" and said Facebook and Google's video subsidiary YouTube already had forms to request data removal. ""Essentially, this is a clash that was ripe to happen. You have Europe's privacy rights, which are very different to the understanding in the US. Privacy is not dead in the EU."" But she said the ECJ ruling would inevitably lead to court cases if Google turns down requests. ""We're entering new territory with the internet."" Google already removes about a million links per month from its index, mainly at the request of music and film copyright holders, said Professor Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, who follows internet governance and registration at the Oxford Internet Institute. ""In that way, they are already editing the web, and have always – there are links to terrorist stuff, neo-Nazi stuff, to child abuse images. Government agencies contact Google and have them take stuff down. ""The real question is, is this going to be more repressive than the other things they are doing? Is it going to negatively impact the trajectory of the internet? I don't think it will."" This article was changed on 2 June. Dina Shiloh was misquoted as saying: ""This is a clash that was right to happen"". This should have read: ""This is a clash that was ripe to happen."""	Technology
13613	13614	Argentina 0-0 Holland 	Once again, Holland were reminded why it is only really the English who tend to be more petrified of penalties. It had been a recurring theme until their quarter-final against Costa Rica and this time Louis van Gaal had already used his three substitutes and could not bring on Tim Krul for his regular goalkeeper, Jasper Cillessen. Argentina had the greater accuracy from 12 yards and Lionel Messi will get his first final. It had been a wretched semi-final until those moments when the players lined up in the centre circle for that last test of nerve and Holland should not just reflect on the inability of Ron Vlaar and Wesley Sneijder to beat the goalkeeper, Sergio Romero, but also the fact their entire team did not manage a single shot on target during the 120 minutes that preceded the shootout. Argentina were not a great deal more effective on a night that should reiterate Germany’s position as the favourites at the Maracanã on Sunday, but the prize for Alejandro Sabella’s team will compensate for the fact it had been such a dreary spectacle. Romero blocked the first attempt from Vlaar and produced an even better save, diving full-length to his right, to turn away Wesley Sneijder’s powerful effort. Either side of that second save, Arjen Robben and Dirk Kuyt had scored for but, without wishing to apportion any blame on Cillessen, there was a good reason why Van Gaal brought on Krul when it reached this stage in the previous round. Cillessen had never saved a penalty in 16 attempts and that number has now extended to 20. Messi put the first one away. Then Ezequiel Garay thumped one into the roof of the net and it was the turn of two of the substitutes, Sergio Agüero and Maxi Rodríguez, to face the Dutch goalkeeper. They both scored. “I taught Romero how to stop penalties [at AZ],” Van Gaal recalled afterwards. “So that hurts. Losing 7-1 is the same as losing on penalties.” His Dutch team have contributed a lot to this tournament and they will also look back on that moment, approaching the end of 90 minutes, when Robben scurried free for the first time in the entire match only to be thwarted by a brilliant saving tackle from Javier Mascherano, just as he was shaping to shoot with the ball on his left foot. The truth, however, is that this was not the same, fluid Dutch team that had illuminated the competition with so much rich promise in the earlier stages. Perhaps they had peaked too soon but there were signs here of a team that did not fully trust in themselves. It made for a prosaic game, with Robben spending more time on the edges than he will care to remember and Robin van Persie so ineffectual he was substituted before the penalties. Their passing was stodgy and sideways and when Robben struggles to make any real impact the Dutch are never quite so effective. It was a long night in the rain of São Paulo and it was strange to see two teams at this level looking so ordinary and short of ideas. The game started slowly and never really quickened up and, by the second half, it had become riddled with carelessness. For the past month, this tournament has had justifiable praise for its entertainment. Here, it would be a deception trying to talk up what happened. It was, in short, a stinker. Messi, in flashes, showed what he can do. In other moments, he walked through the game. For the first hour, Nigel de Jong was deployed to keep him company. Messi is one of the few players in the world who can force opponents into these measures and, at times, Holland looked reticent, maybe even afraid, of risking their shape by committing too many players forward. Argentina began and finished the game as the more menacing side but did not do a great deal in between. Maybe it was the tension that dragged the occasion down but there was a good half an hour when the Argentina fans had to make their entertainment, holding up seven fingers to indulge in some malicious pleasure at what had happened to Brazil the previous night. Sabella’s team were content defending deeply, then trying to hit Messi on the counter-attack, whereas Van Gaal’s players lacked width and penetration. At least there were sporadic moments of danger from Messi, including one jink to the left that would have taken him clear but for a splendid saving tackle from Vlaar. The brutal thing about the penalties was that Vlaar had been the outstanding player on the pitch. Messi did create a late chance for Rodríguez and an even better one for another substitute, Rodrigo Palacio, whose inability to beat Cillessen almost brought Sabella to the point of spontaneous combustion. For Argentina, though, they were scenes of great jubilation at the end. Romero’s goalkeeping had made the difference and, in the process, confirmed a re-run of the 1986 and 1990 finals. If Sunday is to be remembered fondly, however, it might need Sabella’s team to open up.	Football
7648	7649	Theresa May expects Tory manifesto to include net migration target 	 has indicated that she expects the Conservative manifesto to include a target to cut net migration, despite the concerns of senior colleagues and the failure to meet the goal of reducing it to “tens of thousands” in the current parliament. Her comments came after figures showed net migration increased to 298,000 in the year to September and former cabinet minister Ken Clarke called for the policy to be scrapped as it would be impossible to reach the target without damaging the economy. But the home secretary insisted that in the general election manifesto “the idea of the net migration target will still be there”, and stressed the importance of the issue for ministers across Whitehall. “I think we will keep the target,” she told the Times. “It is important because it is about not just dealing with those coming into the system but also about making sure that those people who shouldn’t live here actually leave. Signalling the need for a cross-government effort she said: “Obviously the Home Office is responsible for UK visas and immigration, the Border Force and immigration enforcement but actually immigration is an issue that touches across government departments and has a whole number of different aspects. “It affects issues around jobs, questions of illegal working, access to housing, education, the NHS. It touches all government departments and I think that’s the thing that’s important.” May also indicated she had faced a battle with officials to get them to accept that immigration could cause problems. “There was a problem with the orthodoxy in Whitehall when we came into government in 2010,” she said. “It was the idea that immigration by definition was good – in that automatically if you’ve got more people, GDP goes up. Of course, GDP per head doesn’t necessarily go up – so they didn’t look beyond that point.” Former home secretary Clarke has suggested globalisation had made the immigration target impossible to meet, while Lady Warsi, an ex-Tory party chairwoman, said it was “unrealistic”. Downing Street insisted Cameron’s “ambition” to reduce net migration below 100,000 remained. The prime minister’s official spokesman told a regular Westminster media briefing: “You won’t be surprised to know that he takes a different view from Ken on this one. It won’t be the first time that he and Ken haven’t had exactly the same views.” The spokesman said the PM’s views on the need to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 had not changed since a speech in November, when he said that it remained an “ambition”, even if it was not possible to achieve it during this parliament. Cameron said in November: “The ambition remains the right one, but it’s clear it’s going to take more time, more work and more difficult long-term decisions in order to get there.” The spokesman confirmed that this remained the PM’s view, adding: “He thinks the UK would be a better and stronger country with net migration in the tens of thousands. Those are the reasons he has given before and they haven’t changed.” Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: “Who is Theresa May kidding? Even her own colleagues are saying her net migration target is in tatters. No-one will believe a word she or the prime minister says on this, after they promised ‘no ifs, not buts’ to meet their chosen target last time, yet instead net migration is three times the level they promised. “Theresa May is taking people for fools by trying the same trick again. This massive gap between Tory rhetoric and reality just undermines trust in the immigration system. Labour has always said having a net migration target which treats all immigration the same was the wrong approach. “We need a smarter system of controls for different kinds of migration so that, for example, we can benefit from overseas university students who bring billions into Britain but restrict low skilled migration. And we need much stronger enforcement of the rules to cut illegal immigration. “Immigration is important to Britain but it needs to be controlled and managed so the system is fair. “Labour has set out a series of sensible reforms to strengthen our borders, reform benefit rules so people can’t claim for up to two years and clamp down on those who exploit immigration to undercut jobs and wages.”	Politics
15278	15279	Facebook denies emotion contagion study had government and military ties 	" and Cornell researchers have denied that the controversial “emotion contagion” experiment was funded by the US Department of Defence (DoD). The social network told the Guardian that the study was entirely self-funded and that Facebook is categorically not a willing participant in the DoD’s , which funds research into the modelling of dynamics, risks and tipping points for large-scale civil unrest across the world, under the supervision of various US military agencies. “While Prof Hancock, like many researchers, has conducted work funded by the federal government during his career, at no time did Professor Hancock or his postdoctoral associate Jamie Guillory request or receive outside funding to support their work on this PNAS paper,” John Carberry, director of media relations at Cornell University where the academic work took place, told the Guardian. “Initial wording in an article and press releases generated by Cornell University that indicated outside funding sources was an unfortunate error missed during the editorial review process.” Several that because one of the key academic researchers on the study, , previously had ties with the Minerva Initiative that the Facebook “emotion contagion” work could have been in service of the US military. The Minerva initiative , the year of the global banking crisis, and was established to allow the department to partner with universities ""to improve DoD's basic understanding of the social, cultural, behavioural, and political forces that shape regions of the world of strategic importance to the US"". Cornell University is one of the institutions actively engaged with the Minerva Initiative and currently has a study funded through till 2017 managed by the US Air Force Office of Scientific which aims to develop an empirical model ""of the dynamics of social movement mobilisation and contagions"". The project aims to determine ""the critical mass (tipping point)"" of social contagions by studying their ""digital traces"" in the cases of ""the 2011 Egyptian revolution, the 2011 Russian Duma elections, the 2012 Nigerian fuel subsidy crisis and the 2013 Gazi park protests in Turkey.” Cornell denies that the Facebook “emotion contagion” study that was linked with this project. “Prof Hancock did submit a research grant proposal to the DoD’s Minerva program in 2008 to study language use in support of US efforts to engage social scientists on national security issues, but that proposal was not funded,” explained Carberry. “A similar research project was funded in 2009 by the National Science Foundation. Neither project involved studying emotional contagion or Facebook in any way.” “At no time prior to his work on this paper did Prof Hancock seek federal funding for this work, or any work studying emotional contagion on Facebook,” insisted Carberry. Other US universities including Washington and Maryland are involved in studies directly funded and commissioned by Minerva and the DoD, while the US military also has its own in-house research institutions conducting further studies and projects. Facebook did not want to provide a comment for publication. The row over the ethical implications of the Facebook “emotion contagion” study still rumbles on, despite for the “poorly communicated” study by the social network’s chief operating officer and number two, Sheryl Sandberg. Her apology contrasted with comments made on the same day by Facebook’s head of global policy Monika Bickert, and explained that it was necessary for innovation. She added that legislation which could limit innovation was “concerning”."	Technology
3319	3320	Veils are not appropriate in classrooms or airport security, says Nick Clegg 	"It is not appropriate for students to wear a full veil in the classroom or for people to go through airport security with their faces covered, has said. But the deputy prime minister said he did not want to see a state ban on the wearing of religious items of clothing in particular circumstances. His comments came as a in public places. The Home Office minister Jeremy Browne called for a national debate on whether the state should step in to prevent young women having the veil imposed upon them. His intervention was sparked by a row amid public protests. Browne said he was ""instinctively uneasy"" about restricting religious freedoms, but he added there may be a case to act to protect girls who were too young to decide for themselves whether they wished to wear the veil or not. ""I am instinctively uneasy about restricting the freedom of individuals to observe the religion of their choice,"" . ""But there is genuine debate about whether girls should feel a compulsion to wear a veil when society deems children to be unable to express personal choices about other areas like buying alcohol, smoking or getting married. ""We should be very cautious about imposing religious conformity on a society which has always valued freedom of expression."" Responding to his comments, Clegg said: ""I think there is a debate going on already in households and communities up and down the country. ""My own view, very strongly held, is that we shouldn't end up like other countries issuing edicts or laws from parliament telling people what they should or should not wear. ""This is a free country and people going about their own business should be free to wear what they wish. I think it is very un-British to start telling people what pieces of clothing they should wear. ""I think there are exceptions to that as far as the full veil is concerned – security at airports, for instance. It is perfectly reasonable for us to say the full veil is clearly not appropriate there. ""And I think in the classroom, there is an issue, of course, about teachers being able to address their students in a way where they can address them face-to-face. I think it is quite difficult in the classroom to be able to do that."" A number of Conservative MPs have voiced dismay at the way the Birmingham Metropolitan College case was handled. The college had originally banned niqabs and burqas from its campuses eight years ago on the grounds that students should be easily identifiable at all times. But when a 17-year-old prospective student complained to her local newspaper that she was being discriminated against, a campaign sprang up against the ban, attracting 8,000 signatures to an online petition in just 48 hours. Following the college's decision to withdraw the rule, Downing Street said David Cameron would support a ban in his children's schools, although the decision should rest with the headteacher. However, the prime minister has been coming under growing pressure from his own MPs for a rethink on Department for Education guidelines in order to protect schools and colleges from being ""bullied"". The Tory backbencher Dr Sarah Wollaston said the veils were ""deeply offensive"" and were ""making women invisible"", and called for the niqab to be banned in schools and colleges. : ""It would be a perverse distortion of freedom if we knowingly allowed the restriction of communication in the very schools and colleges which should be equipping girls with skills for the modern world. We must not abandon our cultural belief that women should fully and equally participate in society."" Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, said he was disgusted by Browne's calls to consider banning Muslim girls and young women from wearing the veil in public places. ""This is another example of the double standards that are applied to Muslims in our country by some politicians,"" he said. ""Whatever one's religion they should be free to practise it according to their own choices and any attempt by the government to ban Muslim women will be strongly resisted by the Muslim community. ""We take great pride in the United Kingdom's values of individual freedom and freedom of religion and any attempt by illiberal male politicians to dictate to Muslim women what they should wear will be challenged."" He added: ""We would expect these sorts of comments from the far right and authoritarian politicians and not from someone who allegedly believes in liberal values and freedom."""	Politics
